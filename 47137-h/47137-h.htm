<h2>EDITOR’S PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Publishing Committee of the <span class="smcap">Anthropological
Society</span> have done me the honour to confide to me the
task of editing Dr. Broca’s valuable little volume. This
duty I have now fulfilled, and hope that the members of
the Society and the general public will experience the
same pleasure in reading the translation, as I received
when first I perused the original.</p>

<p>The causes which led the committee to suggest the
publication of the present translation are lucidly expressed
by the motto which Dr. Broca placed on his title-page.
The public mind is so little acquainted with the
real facts relating to the hybridity of the Races of Man,
that its investigation, “<i>non ex vulgi opinione, sed ex
sano judicio</i>,” is necessary to the efficient progress of our
science. Such an appeal, however, necessitates that the
whole subject should be again reviewed, and to attain
this object the perusal of a work on similar principles to
that of Dr. Broca becomes the primary requisite for future
researches. It may be said, that no work which so completely
investigates the whole subject of Human Hybridity
has ever been published, and the Council having confirmed
the recommendation of the Publishing Committee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
I have endeavoured to perform my allotted task with as
much prospect of success as could be anticipated amidst
the pressure of numerous and laborious avocations unconnected
with the Society.</p>

<p>The necessity for the publication of this work in England
may be conceived, when we reflect on the laxly
defined ideas which form an integral part of the intellectual
heritage of even educated Englishmen, with regard
to the problems of anthropology. We have been so often
told, that all races of men have been demonstrably proved
to be fertile <i>inter se</i>, that many have conceived that the
laws regulating this presumed fertility are ascertained
and fixed, beyond the reach of disproof, or even of doubt.
The Author and Editor of the following pages are, however,
of a different opinion; and are content to wait for
the accumulation of future facts.</p>

<p>To obviate any misconstruction which may be placed
on my meaning on this topic, I shall quote the words of
the great Dutch philosopher:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I invite not the vulgar, therefore, nor those whose minds, like
theirs, are full of prejudices, to the perusal of this book. I would
much rather that they should entirely neglect it, than that they
should misconstrue its purpose and contents after the fashion usual
with them.”</p></div>

<p>I should have felt more gratification if the task of interpreting
the thoughts of the great French master of
our science had fallen into worthier hands than my
own. The habitual methods of thought of Dr. <span class="smcap">Paul
Broca</span> are so exact, his style so terse, his knowledge
of the literature of Anthropology so vast, and his power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
of application and concentration of ideas so powerful,
that a just preference might have selected another Editor.
It has scarcely been necessary for me to add a single
foot-note to the lucid exposition of the Secretary of our
parent Society.</p>

<p>It is my pleasurable duty to thank my friend Dr.
James Hunt, the President of our Society, for the kindness
by which he placed in my hands the editorship of
this volume, and for many most valuable suggestions
regarding it. To my colleague Mr. J. Frederick Collingwood,
for whose friendly assistance in the performance
of the secretarial duties I am indebted for the leisure
which has enabled me to edit this work, my thanks are
also due.</p>

<p>To the Council and to the Society I now commit
this little tract, an earnest of the more important works
which will be hereafter published during the year 1864,
in the hope that it may ultimately advance the best interests
of the science all sincere anthropologists must
desire to aid.</p>

<h2>GLOSSARIAL NOTE.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The significations of the following words, habitually used by Dr.
Broca, are appended:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Agenesic.</span> Mongrels of the first generation, entirely unfertile,
either between each other, or with the two parent species, and
consequently being unable to produce either direct descendants
or mongrels of the second generation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dysgenesic.</span> Mongrels of the first generation, nearly altogether
sterile.</p>

<p class="left padl2"><i>a.</i> Unfertile with each other, therefore with no direct descendants.</p>

<p class="left padl2"><i>b.</i> They sometimes, but rarely and with difficulty, breed with
one or the other parent species. The mongrels of the
second generation, produced by this interbreeding, are
infertile.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Paragenesic.</span> Mongrels of the first generation having a partial
fecundity.</p>

<p class="left padl2"><i>a.</i> They are hardly fertile or infertile <i>inter se</i>, and when they
produce direct descendants, these have merely a decreasing
fertility, tending to necessary extinction at the end of some
generations.</p>

<p class="left padl2"><i>b.</i> They breed easily with one at least of the two parent
species. The mongrels of the second generation, issued
from this second breeding, are themselves and their descendants
fertile <i>inter se</i>, and with the mongrels of the
first generation, with the nearest allied pure species, and
with the intermediate mongrels arising from these various
crossings.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Eugenesic.</span> Mongrels of the first generation entirely fertile.</p>

<p class="left padl2"><i>a.</i> They are fertile <i>inter se</i>, and their direct descendants are
equally so.</p>

<p class="left padl2"><i>b.</i> They breed easily and indiscriminately with the two
parent species; the mongrels of the second generation, in
their turn are, themselves and their descendants, indefinitely
fertile, both <i>inter se</i> or with the mongrels of all
kinds which result from the mixture of the two parent
species.</p></div>

THE PHENOMENA OF HYBRIDITY IN THE HUMAN
SPECIES.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<h2>SECTION I.</h2>

<h3 style="visibility: visible; page-break-before: never;">GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON CROSSING IN HUMAN RACES.<br /><br /></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> very ingenious writer, M. A. de Gobineau,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> whose
efforts have been directed towards bringing the light of modern
ethnology to bear upon the political and social history of nations,
but who, in this very difficult and almost entirely new
inquiry, has more than once indulged in paradoxical generalisations,
has thought proper to affirm, in his <i>Essay on the Inequality
of Human Races</i> (1855), that the crossing of races constantly
produces disastrous effects, and that, sooner or later, a
physical and moral degeneration is the inevitable result thereof.
It is, therefore, chiefly to this cause that he attributes the decline
of the Roman Republic and the downfall of liberty, which was
soon followed by the decline of civilisation. I am very far from
sharing his opinion, and, were this the proper place, I might
show that the social corruption and the intellectual degradation
which prepared the ruin of the Roman power was due to quite
different causes. M. Gobineau’s proposition appears to me
by far too general; and I am still more opposed to the opinion
of those who advance that every mixed race separated from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>parent stocks is incapable of perpetuation.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> It has even been
asserted that the United States of America, where the Anglo-Saxon
race is still predominant, but which is overrun by immigrants
of various other races, is, by that very circumstance,
threatened with decay, inasmuch as this continuous immigration
may have the effect of producing a hybrid race containing
the germ of future sterility. Do we not know that, on the
faith of this prognostication, a certain party has proposed the
restriction of foreign immigration, and even in England there
have been serious men who have predicted, from ethnological
causes, the overthrow of the United States, just as Ezekiel predicted
the ruin of Alexandria.</p>

<p>When we see the prosperity and the power of the new continent
grow with such unexampled rapidity, we can certainly
put no faith in such a prediction. Still there must have been
a certain number of fundamental facts, which led even monogenists
to deny the viability of <i>all</i> crossed races. They must
have sought in vain among the nations of the earth for a race
manifestly hybrid, with well-defined characters, intermediate
between two known races, perpetuating itself without the concurrence
of the parent races.</p>

<p>“When the facts quoted above,” says M. Georges Pouchet,
“are not sufficient to prove that a mongrel breed cannot be engendered,
can we anywhere find one? Do we find a people
conserving a medium type between two other types? We see
them nowhere just as little as we see a race of mules. The fact
is, that such a race, such a type can only have an ephemeral
subjective existence.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<h3>Pretended examples of hybrid races (note on the Griquas of Southern Africa)</h3>

<p>The question, where do we find hybrid races subsisting by
themselves, has been asked before M. Pouchet. Dr. Prichard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>in replying to it, could only find three instances:&mdash;1. The
Griquas, the progeny of the Hottentots and the Dutch. 2. The
Cafusos of the forests of Varama (Brazil), a race described by
Spix and Martius, and, according to them, the offspring of indigenous
Americans and African Negroes. 3. The mop-headed
Papuans inhabiting the island of Waigiou and the surrounding
islands and the northern part of New Guinea, and
who, according to MM. Quoy and Gaimard, are a hybrid race,
the issue of a union of Malays and the Papuans proper.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>These three examples have been objected to, and are indeed
liable to objections.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> We know next to nothing about the Cafusos,
and no one can positively assert that they have remained
unmixed with the indigenous race; but we know for certain
that the Griquas have risen since the commencement of this
century around a Protestant mission, by the fusion of some
Dutch-Hottentot <i>bastaard</i> families with a large number of the
Hottentot race, the Bosjesmen, and the Kaffir race. This example
then proves, by no means, that a mixed race can perpetuate
itself separately.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the mop-headed Papuans, they live in a region
the ethnography of which is scarcely known. MM. Quoy
and Gaimard are of opinion that they are the issue of a mixture
between the Malays and indigenous Negroes (<i>sic</i>); but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>only advanced this opinion as an hypothesis: “They appeared
to us to hold a medium place between those people (Malays) and
the Negroes in regard to character, physiognomy, and the nature
of their hair.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> This is all those authors say; but Mr. Lesson
instead of quoting this as a mere hypothesis, says, “These
people have been perfectly described by MM. Quoy and Gaimard,
who were the first to <i>demonstrate</i> that they constitute a hybrid
race, and are, <i>unquestionably</i>, the issue of Papuans (properly
so called) and Malays located in those parts, and which form
the mass of the population.” Mr. de Rienzi, on the other
hand, has described two varieties of Papuan hybrids: one
variety the issue of a crossing between the Papuans and the
Malays,&mdash;the Papou-Malays; the second variety, the issue
of an intermixture between the Papuans and the Alforian-Endamenes&mdash;the
Pou-Endamenes.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> There is already a complication
here. Now comes Mr. Maury, who maintains that
the race issued from the Papuans and Malays is the Alforian
race.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> What are we to conclude from these contradictions?
M. Quoy and Gaimard had a certain impression, M. Rienzi
entertained a somewhat different impression, to which the
authorities cited by Mr. Maury are altogether opposed. All
is then, as yet, an hypothesis, and the question is as yet
doubtful. In this uncertainty it might well be asked whether
the Malays, the Alfourous, the mop-headed Papuans, and the
Papuans properly so called might not be as many pure races.
It is not merely in the region of the mop-headed Papuans that
the other three races are to be met with. The Malays, an invading
people <i>par excellence</i>, have, like the English, established
themselves on all the coasts accessible to their vessels, and if
the mop-headed race occupies only a very confined district, and
is perfectly unknown elsewhere where the same elements are
present, we are permitted to conclude that it is not the result
of an intermixture. Moreover, Dr. Latham, the most zealous
of Dr. Prichard’s pupils, informs us that Mr. Earle has seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>and described “the real and undoubted hybrids” of the Papuans
and Malays, and that these are altogether different from the
mop-headed Papuans.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>It will be perceived that the example of the Papuans is a
worse selection than that of the Griquas, since it is very probable
that those mop-headed men, the type of which was so perfectly
described by Dampier two centuries ago, having been
since preserved without alteration, are a pure race. Granting
even that it is demonstrated that they belong to a hybrid race,
they can scarcely be cited as a mixed race persisting by themselves,
since, so far from living secluded from the two races
from which they are said to be the issue, they live with them in
the same localities. MM. Quoy and Gaimard, in their description
of these pretended mongrels, add that there were Negroes
among them (by which name they designate the Papuans proper)
which formed a part of the tribe which visited us daily. There
were even among them two individuals of a higher complexion,
which, rightly or wrongly, were considered to be descended
from Europeans or Chinese. It was thus a very mixed people.
Mr. Lesson, speaking of the population of the small island of
Waigiou,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> says that two races are found there, the Malays and
the Alfourous, besides the hybrid races of the Papuans: “These
are men without vigour or moral energy, subjected to the
authority of the Malay rajahs, and frequently reduced to
slavery by the surrounding islanders.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> But it is well known
what is the consequence of slavery, especially under an equatorial
climate, and among a people given to incontinency. It
is, then, simply impossible that the mop-headed race of the
Isle of Waigiou should remain free from intermixture with the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>Alfourous and the Malays, and if this race be really hybrid, it
is not easy to see how Prichard and his adherents are authorised
to assert that they persist by themselves.</p>

<p>The three examples adduced by Prichard having thus
proved without any absolute value, a diametrically opposite
doctrine has been advanced. It has been said that since this
author was obliged to go so far for such indifferent examples,
it amounts to a proof that he could not find any others,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> and
the conclusion was arrived at that a mixed race neither has
nor could have a permanent existence.</p>

<p>This novel assertion is perfectly erroneous, and if it found
adherents, it is simply because the question has been badly
put; because the word <i>race</i> has not received a precise signification,
and consequently, a very confused acceptation has been
given to the term.</p>

<p>Among the various characters which distinguish the numerous
varieties of the <i>genus homo</i>, some are more or less important,
and more or less evident. To distinguish two races, a
single character, however slight, is sufficient, provided it be
hereditary and sufficiently fixed. If, for instance, two peoples
differed merely from each other by the colour of the hair and
the beard, though they may resemble each other in every other
respect, by the simple fact that the one has black, whilst the
other has fair hair, it may be asserted that they are not of the
same race. This is the popular and the true meaning of the
term race, which, however, does not necessarily implicate the
idea either of identity or diversity of origin. Thus all ethnologists
and historians, all the monogenists, and polygenistic
authors say that the Irish proper are not of the same race as
the English. The Germans, the Celts, the Basques, the
Sclaves, the Jews, Arabs, Kabyles, etc., etc., are considered
more or less separate races, more or less easy to be characterised,
and more or less distinguished by their manners, tongues,
history and origin. There are thus a large number of human
races; but if, instead of considering all the characters, we confine
ourselves to take into consideration but a few of the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>important, or if, after having by an analytical process, first
studied the various races separately, we now subject them to a
synthetic process, we soon recognise that there exists among
them numerous affinities, which enable us to dispose them in
a certain number of natural groups.</p>

<p>The ensemble of the characters common to each group, constitute
the type of that group. Thus, all the races we have
just enumerated, and many others, have the skin white, regular
features, soft hair, oval face, vertical jaws, and elliptical
cranium, etc. These points of resemblance give them in
some sort a family likeness, by which they are recognised at
once, and which has caused them to be designated by the
collective name of Caucasian races. The hyperborean races,
and those of Eastern Asia, constitute the family of Mongolian
races; the group of Ethiopian races equally comprises a large
number of black races with woolly hair, and a prognathous
head. The American and the Malayo-Polynesian races form
the two last groups.</p>

<p>It must not be believed that all human races can with equal
facility be ranged in either of these divisions; nor must we
believe that the characteristic traits of one group are equally
marked in all the dependent races; nor even that they are
found combined in any of these races; nor, finally, that in the
centre of each group we find a typical race in which all the
characters have their maximum of development. This might
be the case if all known races had descended from five primitive
stocks, as admitted by several polygenists, or if, as many
monogenists think, humanity, <i>one</i> in the beginning, had soon
afterwards been divided into five principal trunks, from which
issued, as so many accessory branches, the numerous sub-divisions
which constitute the secondary races. But there is
no race which can pretend to personify within itself the type to
which it belongs. This type is fictitious; the description is an
ideal one, like the forms of the Apollo de Belvedere. Human
types, like all other types, are merely abstractions, and in proportion
as we attach more importance to this or that character,
we obtain a more or less considerable number of types. Thus,
Blumenbach had five, Cuvier only three, and Bérard describes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
fifteen types. This is also proved by the fact, that whilst many
races attach themselves directly and evidently to a fixed type,
there are others belonging to two very dissimilar types. Thus
the Abyssinians are Caucasian in form and Ethiopian by colour.
The description of the principal types is thus merely a methodical
process, fit to facilitate, by the formation of a certain number
of groups, the comparison of human races, and to simplify the
partial description of each. This division has, moreover, the
advantage of establishing for the greater part of the races,
their degree of relative affinity or divergence. It even accords
to a certain point with their primitive repartition upon the
surface of the globe, which has permitted, without doing any
violence to the facts, to distinguish the types by denominations
borrowed from geography.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>There is in the human mind a tendency to personify abstractions.
These ideal types have usurped a place in the domain
of facts, so that a real existence has been given to them. The
monogenists had, strictly speaking, a right to do so without
any violence to their principles; but the polygenists, who
have followed their example, have sinned against logic. The
former attribute all varieties of the human species to the numerous
modifications of five <i>principal</i> races, issued themselves
from one common stock, and the same influences which, according
to then, have in the origin produced fundamental races, have
afterwards by an analogous process produced the <i>secondary</i> races.
All this is sufficiently clear; and such stood the question when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>the polygenists appeared in the arena. Their first efforts were
directed to attack the doctrine in its essential foundations, and
to demonstrate that by no natural causation could Whites be
transformed into Negroes, or Negroes into Mongolians; they
therefore proclaimed the multiplicity of human origin and the
plurality of species. Be it that they have shrunk from the
idea of causing too great a revolution in science, or that they
thought that it would conduce sooner to the triumph of their
doctrine, they retained as far as possible the number of species,
and confined themselves to assume a primitive stock for
each of the five races described by the Unitarians. I do not
assert that all polygenists followed this course, as some proceeded
in a more independent manner. Bory de Saint-Vincent,
Desmoulins, P. Bérard, Morton, had the courage to break entirely
with the past, and to remodel the classical divisions.
They found, however, but few imitators; and many polygenists
are to this day content to assign a distinct origin to each of the
five principal trunks, which constitute for the monogenists the
five fundamental races, but which are to us only natural groups
formed by the union of races or species of the same type.
They continue also very often to use the term <i>race</i> to designate
the <i>ensemble</i> of all individuals of each group, adopting thus by
a sort of transaction the language of those whose system they
reject; and thus they speak of the white or Caucasian race,
the yellow or Mongolian race, the black or Ethiopian race, etc.,
as if all these individuals of a Caucasian type resembled each
other to constitute one race; as if, for instance, the brown Celts
and the fair-haired Germans had descended from the same
primitive stock. This contradiction has given a handle to the
monogenists; for if climate and mode of life may cause a German
to become a Celt, there is no reason why, under certain influences,
a Celt might not become a Berber, a Berber a Foulah,
a Foulah a Negro, and a Negro an Australian.</p>

<p>I easily comprehend how careful we ought to be to employ in
Anthropology the term <i>species</i>. It can scarcely be used with
certainty until science has clearly circumscribed the limits of
each species of men. This moment is not come yet, and may,
perhaps, never arrive, for, in the midst of constant changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
produced by crossing, migrations, and conquests, and with the
certainty that several races, or a great number of them, have
disappeared within historical time,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> it seems impossible to appreciate
the degree of purity of certain races, to discover their
origin, to know whether they are autochthonic or exotic,
whether they belonged originally to this or that Fauna, and
re-establish the Ethnology of our planet as it was in the beginning.
To fix the number of primitive species of men, or
even the number of actual species, is an insoluble problem to
us, and probably to our successors. The attempts of Desmoulins
et Bory de Saint Vincent have only produced imperfect
sketches, which have led to contradictory classifications, where
the number of arbitrary divisions is nearly equal to more
natural divisions.</p>

<p>The term species has, in classical language, an absolute
sense, implying both the idea of a special conformation and
special origin, and if some races&mdash;the Australians, for instance&mdash;unite
these conditions in a sufficient degree, to constitute a
clearly marked species, many other pure or mixed races escape,
in this respect, a rigorous appreciation. It is for these reasons
that many polygenists, after having proclaimed the multiplicity
of the origins of humanity, and having recognised the impossibility
of determining the number and the characters of the
primitive stocks, have justly avoided methodically to divide the
human genus into species. Many among them, however, who
thought that they were, nevertheless, bound to establish divi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>sions,
have committed the error to accept the basis of the classification
of the monogenists, and, like them, to establish
five chief human families, and, like them, to admit that the
individuals of each family are issued from a common trunk,
with this difference, that, whilst the monogenists assume that
the five primary trunks have proceeded from the same stock,
and have the same roots, the pentagenists (if we may use this
term) assume five distinct and independent stocks. Logically
speaking, it would have been requisite to term the five fundamental
races of the monogenists <i>species</i>, but it is easy to perceive
that, for many reasons, the term species cannot be employed
here in an absolute sense. The pentagenists have felt
this, and, for want of a better term, use the word <i>race</i>, which
has thus been diverted from its real acceptation.</p>

<h3>Significations of the words race and type</h3>

<p>The word <i>race</i> has thus, in the language of authors, two very
different significations; one is particular and exact, the other
general and misleading. Taken in the first sense, it designates
individuals sufficiently resembling each other, that we may,
without prejudging their origin, and without deciding whether
they are the issues of one or several primitive couples, admit,
if necessary, as theoretically possible, that they have descended
from common parents. Such are, for instance, among the
white races, the Arabs, the Basques, the Celts, the Kimris, the
Germans, the Berbers, etc.; and among the black races, the
Ethiopian Negroes, the Caffres, the Tasmanians, Australians,
Papuans, etc.</p>

<p>In the second, that is to say, in a general sense, the term
race designates the <i>ensemble</i> of all such individuals who have a
certain number of characters in common, and who, though differing
in other characters, and divided, perhaps, in an indefinite
number of natural groups or races, have to each other a
greater morphological affinity than they have with the rest of
mankind.</p>

<p>Every confusion in words exposes us to errors in the interpretation
of facts, and this rather long digression in relation to
the origin of a denomination, borrowed by certain polygenists
from the language of monogenists, enables us to understand the
denial of the existence of mixed races, and why Prichard could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
only oppose to this idea the doubtful and fictitious examples of
the Cafusos, the Griquas, and the mop-headed Papuans.</p>

<p>If, indeed, it were true that there are only five races of men
on the globe, and if it were capable of demonstration that either
of them, in mixing with another, produced eugenesic Mulattos
capable of constituting a mixed race enduring by itself, without
the ulterior concurrence of the parent races, the embarrassment
would not yet be at an end. After having succeeded to establish
such a demonstration for two of the chief races, it would by no
means necessarily result that the intercrossings of the nine other
combinations are eugenesic like the first. We should then be
obliged to prove (what is evidently impracticable), by ten successive
examples, that the ten possible intercrossings between
the five fundamental races are all equally and completely prolific.
The difficulty is such, that Dr. Prichard, after much research,
could only find the three instances already cited and
refuted. These facts having proved inconclusive, and other
facts which we shall mention presently having induced the
theory that <i>certain</i> intermixtures are imperfectly prolific, the
pentagenists were led to the opinion that the possibility of a
definitive intermixture of races is by no means established, and
that, on the contrary, this possibility may be denied.</p>

<p>The pentagenists occupied themselves at first chiefly with the
intermixture of the five chief races; but even from this point of
view, and taking the term race in a general sense, their negation,
though, it must be admitted, far from being justifiable, is
still founded upon a more solid basis, and less removed from the
truth than the opposed affirmation. Hence it was considered
valuable <i>ad interim</i>. But the principle of non-intermixture of
races being once promulgated, the confusion of terms soon became
apparent. The negation which was at first applied merely
to the artificial groups formed by the reunion of races of the
same type was applied to natural races, and thus arose that
frightful proposition, that <i>no mixed races can subsist in humanity</i>.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy how this excessive and exclusive theory differs
from the first, which it has displaced. There is such a gap
between the starting point and the conclusion, that it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
never have been cleared had not the ambiguous term <i>race</i> concealed
the distance. The fact is established that affinities of
organisation may exercise some influence on the results of
crossing. In studying the phenomena of hybridity in quadrupeds
and birds, we have already stated that homœogenesis,
without being <i>always</i> proportionate to the degree of the proximity
of species, decreases <i>ordinarily</i> in comparison with more
removed animals, and that probability induces us to expect
similar phenomena in the intermixture of human beings. But
what have been the bases of the monogenists and of the pentagenists
in forming the five ethnological groups, which constitute
the five fundamental races? Why have all Caucasian races
been united by them in one family, and called by them <i>the white</i>
or the Caucasian race? It has been already stated because the
races with a skin more or less white possess between themselves
a greater affinity than with any of the other races. In other
terms, the zoological distance is less between Celts, Germans,
Kimris, etc., compared with that existing between them and the
Negroes, Caffres, Lapps, Australians, Malays, etc.</p>

<p>Supposing now that it has been demonstrated&mdash;which it has
not&mdash;that the races of any group can <i>never</i> engender a durable
and permanent line by an intermixture with any of the others,
can we infer from this that the races of the same group are
equally incapable of producing by their intermixture mongrels
indefinitely prolific? Just as little as the sterility of the union
between the dog and the fox would enable us to infer the
sterility between the wolf and the dog; these conclusions would
be as little physiological as the former. Such as deny the
fecundity of the reciprocal cross-breeds of the five chief primary
races might err in some points, and be right as to others. But
those who extend this by far too general negation in applying
it to the intermixture of secondary races of the same group
commit a more serious error. They have reasoned like the
monogenists, who knowing from experience that <i>certain</i> human
races may become mixed without limitation, have affirmed that
<i>all</i> the races, without exception, are in a similar condition.
There obtains thus a strange contradiction in these two schools;
the one maintains resolutely that all races may intermix, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
that their offspring and their descendants will be as prolific
as if they were of a pure race, whilst the second as firmly sustains
that no mixed race can have any other but an ephemeral
existence.</p>

<p>Between these opposite assertions we may well ask where
lies the truth? Facts must answer the question. We shall
endeavour to examine a few. Some of the facts are in favour
of the monogenists, others support the opinion of their adversaries,
from which we shall be enabled to infer that in the <i>genus
homo</i>, as in the genera of their mammalia, there are different
degrees of homœogenesis, according to the races or species;
that the cross-breeds of certain races are perfectly eugenesic;
that others occupy a less elevated position in the series of hybridity;
and finally, that there are human races the homœogenesis
of which is still so obscure, that the results even of the
first intermixture are still doubtful.</p>

<h2>SECTION II.</h2>
<h3 style="visibility: visible; page-break-before: never;">OF EUGENESIC HYBRIDITY IN MANKIND.<br /><br /></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the opinion I wish to combat were not supported by authors
of If, perhaps, be superfluous to
demonstrate that there exists in the human species <i>eugenesic
hybrids</i>. Most of the readers of these pages must reconcile
themselves to this qualification, for assuredly men of a pure
race are very rare in the country they inhabit. Nothing is, in
fact, more clear than that many modern nations, to commence
with the French, have been formed by the intermixture of two
or more races. My excellent teacher, Gerdy,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> has devoted a
long chapter, in his Physiology, to this subject, and has, after
great research, arrived at the conclusion that all, or nearly all,
actual races have been crossed more than once, and that the
primitive types of mankind, altered and modified by so many
crossings, are no longer represented upon the earth. There is
here much exaggeration: for there are races who, by a peculiar
geographical situation, and the prejudices of caste or religion,
have remained in a state of purity; and on the other hand, as
M. P. Bérard<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> remarks, it is not sufficient for the production
of a mongrel race, that two groups of different races should
become allied and fused. If in either of the groups there
exists too great a numerical inequality, the mongrels resume,
after the lapse of a few generations, nearly all the traits of the
more numerous race, and are fused in it. It is for this reason
that, despite of numerous crossings, many races have preserved
all their characters from remote antiquity. I have already had
occasion to observe that the <i>Fellahs</i> of present Egypt are
exactly like the figures represented upon the Pharaonic epoch.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
No country has, however, been so frequently conquered as
Egypt, which from Cambyses to Mehemet-Ali, for more than
twenty-three centuries has been governed and oppressed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>peoples of foreign races, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs,
Turks, and Mamelukes. The Macedonian colonies, founded by
Alexander and his successors, soon lost their ethnological
character.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Southern Italy has not preserved the impress of
the Norman race. It would be vain to search in Asia Minor
for the descendants of the Gauls with fair hair,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> who once established
themselves in Galatia; and though the Visigoths
possessed Spain for more than two centuries, and have never
been expelled from it, and we may without exaggeration compute
the number of the conquerors at several hundred thousand,
and though their blood, mitigated by intermixture, runs to this
day in the veins of an immense number of Spaniards, the latter
have preserved no trace of their Germanic origin.</p>

<p>But when the intermixture of races is effected in nearly
equal proportions, or if it be the result, not of one invasion,
but of a constant and abundant immigration, the case is altogether
different, and the fusion of the ethnological elements
gives rise to a hybrid population, in which the number of individuals
of a pure race is constantly diminishing, so that at
the termination of a few centuries the representatives of the
two primitive types become the exceptions. In a long Memoir
“On the Ethnology of France,” which I lately read before the
Anthropological Society of Paris, I have shown to what extent
intermixture may modify the physiognomy of a people. Examining
in the first place the records of history on hand, the
origin of the populations of our departments, and appreciating
as much as possible the proportion of the elements which we
find in combination; determining, also, for each region the
principal and the accessory stocks, I have been enabled to find
in the present French nation, in the midst of the innumerable
variations of stature, complexion, hair, eyes, cephalic shapes,
etc., which may everywhere be expected in mixed races; I have
been able to detect, I repeat, the characters of these different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>races, and to recognise the more or less marked and dominant
impress of the Celts, Kimris, Romans, and Germans. I was
even enabled, on the statistics of recruiting, to give to my
inquiries, in regard to stature, a rigorous precision. I cannot
in this place enter into any details: I am obliged to refer the
reader to the Memoir, which is published by the Anthropological
Society. In point of fact, it was merely because eminent
men have for some years doubted the existence of eugenesic
hybridity in mankind, that it became necessary to demonstrate
so evident a proposition, that the population of France in at
least nineteen-twentieths of our territory, presents in unequal
degrees the characters of mixed races.</p>

<p>This single example might suffice; but I have no doubt that
by examining in a similar manner the historical origin and the
actual condition of the peoples of Northern Italy, Southern
Germany, Great Britain&mdash;not to speak of the United States,
where the fusion of blood is probably inexplicable&mdash;it might be
demonstrated with equal certainty, that these different races
have given birth, by their intermixture, to ethnological modifications
still recognisable. In all these countries is the instability
of anthropological characters in contrast with the fixity which
is the mark of pure races; and we might say, without fear of
error, that the greater part of Western Europe is inhabited by
mixed races.</p>

<p>Moreover, the authors who have denied the existence of
mixed races, have not denied that there are in Europe and elsewhere,
numerous vivacious populations, formed by the intermixture
of two or several distinct races. They merely asserted
that mongrel breeds, whatever their origin, were necessarily
inferior in reference to fecundity to individuals of pure blood,
and that their direct descendants would become extinct after a
few generations, unless they contracted new alliances with the
mother races, or at least with one of them. If we object to
this, that the mixed populations possess everywhere, as those
of France and Great Britain, a vitality and fecundity which
leaves nothing to be desired, they reply that this proves nothing;
that the cross breeds are prolific in a collateral line, as is observed
in cases of paragenesic hybridity, and they add that two
cases may present themselves:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>1. If among the two primitive races these obtain a very large
numerical inequality, the predominant race soon absorbs the
other. After two or three generations, the less numerous race
counts scarcely one representative, and the cross-breeds are
fused in the more numerous race. The latter thus returns to a
state of original purity. The mixed race has only a transitory
duration, and leaves no trace of its existence.</p>

<p>2. If, on the contrary, the two races, though numerically
unequal, are in sufficient proportion that neither can absorb the
other, both persist indefinitely beside each other upon the same
soil. The hybrid race which they engender, seems also to
persist indefinitely; but only in appearance, for they constantly
intermarry with the pure races, while the latter marry between
themselves. The mixed race gains thus, in every generation, a
contingent equal to what it loses, those which represent it at
present are not the descendants of those who represented the
mixed race five or six generations back. It is not maintained
by itself: existing only under the condition of being sustained
by the races from which it is issued, and if there arrived a time
when it is completely isolated from these two races, and reduced
to its own forces, it would necessarily become extinct
after a few generations.</p>

<p>I might urge some objection against the first point, for it
does not seem to me to be demonstrated, that in a mixture of
very unequal proportions, the less numerous race exercises <i>no
influence</i> upon the other race. I acknowledge, however, that
this influence, if it exists, is sufficiently slight to be set aside.</p>

<p>The second point is much more serious, for if accepted without
restriction, we must admit that eugenesic hybridity does
not exist in mankind, and that all cross-breeds, whatever their
origin, whether they are issued from nearly approaching or distant
races, not merely the descendants of whites and negroes,
but also of Celts and Kimris, are incapable of engendering a
durable posterity. For my part, I believe that such is actually
the case with certain mongrel-breeds; I believe that in the
genus <i>Homo</i>, there are very unequal degrees of eugenesic
hybridity; but after having recognised that eugenesic hybridity
does exist between dog and wolf, hare and rabbit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
goat and sheep, camel and dromedary, I am permitted to say
that it also exists between certain races of men.</p>

<p>Among the facts quoted to prove the sterility of human
cross-breeds, some are of great value: and we shall examine
them in the sequel; others have been wrongly interpreted,
while some are far from being exact. I have already pointed
out a cause of error which was not taken into account, and
which occurs frequently: it is the change of climate which
alone is capable of sterilising a race transplanted into the midst
of another race. Before attributing a defect of fecundity to
the mixed descendants of an immigrant race, we must see
whether in the same country the individuals of this race are
more prolific in their direct alliances. It is known, for instance,
that the Mamelukes, originating from the region of the Caucasus,
have never taken root in Egypt, where, nevertheless, from
1250, the epoch of their advent, until 1811, the period of their
extermination, their caste has always formed a notable part of
the population. They could only maintain themselves by reinforcements
which they annually received from the native
country, and though not half a century has elapsed since the
great massacre of Cairo, there remains no trace of them on
the borders of the Nile. Such being the fact, it was concluded
therefrom, that the descendants of the Mamelukes and the
Egyptians were hybrids of little or no fecundity. Gliddon
has thus interpreted it, and Pouchet has accepted that interpretation.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
This, however, is not the real cause of the sterility of
the Mamelukes in Egypt, and Volney, who, towards the end of
the last century, has carefully observed and studied this race,
offers the following remarks on them: “Seeing that they have
existed in Egypt for centuries, one would be apt to believe that
they have reproduced themselves by the ordinary process of
breeding; but if their first settlement is a curious fact, their
perpetuation is not less so. For five centuries there have been
Mamelukes in Egypt, yet not one of them has left a subsisting
line: there exists not one family of the second generation, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>their children perish in the first or second generation. <i>The
Ottomans are nearly in the same condition</i>, and it is observed
that they only preserve themselves from the same fate by
marrying indigenous females&mdash;what the <i>Mamelukes have always
disdained</i>. (The wives of the Mamelukes were, like their slaves,
imported from Georgia, Mongrelia, etc.) Let it now be explained
why well formed men, married to healthy women,
cannot naturalise on the borders of the Nile a blood formed at
the foot of the Caucasus! We are at the same time reminded
that European plants equally refuse to perpetuate their species
in that locality.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Despite the precision of this passage, many
Mamelukes no doubt took wives and numerous concubines from
the indigenous population. It is difficult to believe that it
could have been otherwise, and Gliddon had a right to say, that
if the offspring of the two races had been prolific, there would
inevitably have been produced in Egypt a mixed race. But
the fact revealed by Volney, which is perfectly authentic, still
maintains its force, namely, that the Mamelukes, by the simple
fact of change of country, had lost the power of engendering
<i>with the women of their own race</i>, a prolific posterity; hence,
nothing proves that the sterility of their offspring depended
on the influence of hybridity, but rather on the influence of
climate.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose successively to review all particular
intermixtures produced in human races, or to determine the
degree of the fecundity of the hybrids resulting from it.</p>

<p>To demonstrate that eugenesic hybridity really exists, one
instance is sufficient, provided it be conclusive; and to find
this example we need not travel beyond our country. The
population of France, as we have amply established elsewhere,
is descended from several very distinct races, and presents
everywhere the character of mixed races. The pure representatives
of the primitive races form a very small minority; nevertheless,
this hybrid nation, so far from decaying, in accordance
with the theory of Mr. Gobineau; far from presenting a
decreasing fecundity, according to some other authors, grows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>every day in intelligence, prosperity, and numbers. Ever since
the revolution has broken the last obstacle which opposed
themselves to the mixture of races, and despite of the gigantic
wars which during twenty-five years mowed down the <i>élite</i> of
its male population, France has seen the number of its inhabitants
increase by more than one-third; this is not a symptom
of decay. Dr. Knox, in his curious essay on the Races of
Men (London, 1850), has thought proper to utter, in relation
to the French, some hard truths: and also some calumnies,
which we shall put to the account of his patriotism. Mr.
Knox has accorded to the French nation an increasing physical
prosperity, and as this side of the question is the only one
which occupies us here, we might dispense with any other
testimony. That learned author thought what he said about
the French applied exclusively to the Celtic race; he supposed
that upon our soil there were nought but pure Celts, and that
the other ethnological elements have not in any degree modified
the character of the old Gallic race. I have refuted this
assertion at some length in my <i>Mémoire sur l’Ethnologie de la
France</i>, and Dr. Knox,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> in praising in his own manner the
Celtic race, has not perceived that unconsciously, and contrary
to his own system, he wrote the apology of a strongly mixed
race. But the partisans of this system will doubtless say that,
on the whole, the mixed Kimro-Celtic race, which now inhabits
France, does not subsist by itself; that the two parent races, the
Celts and the Kimris, one of which predominates in the north-east,
the other in the north-west, the south and the centre,
persist, almost pure, in their respective regions, and that the
mixed race only maintains itself by recruiting themselves incessantly
in these vivacious <i>foci</i>. My reply to this is, that the
individuals perfectly representing the Celtic or Kimri type are
infinitely rarer than the rest, even in the departments where
history or observation demonstrates that the influence of one
of these races is altogether preponderant. They are especially
rare in the districts of the intermediary zone, which I have
termed Kimro-Celtic, and where the two chief races have origi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>nally
become intermixed in nearly equal proportions. Finally,
in these latter departments, where the intermixture has been
strongest, the population is neither less handsome, nor less
robust or prolific than in the others. As regards the vigour of
the constitution, I have consulted in the registers for recruiting
the special list of exemptions on account of infirmities, that
is, for other physical causes than stature. I have found that,
other circumstances being equal, there are as many infirm in
1000 conscripts in the purest departments, as in the mixed
districts. I cannot here dwell any longer upon this proposition,
of which I have given a rigorous demonstration in my
<i>Mémoire sur l’Ethnologie de la France</i>.</p>

<p>There remains now the question of fecundity. The causes
which determine the increase or the decay of a population are
so multifarious, and for the most part so foreign to ethnological
influences, that we cannot without committing grave errors,
estimate the degree of fecundity of different races, in comparing
for each of them, the number of births and deaths. It appears,
nevertheless, very probable that all the races are not equally
prolific, and the mind easily perceives that there must be between
them notable differences. It is, therefore, unnecessary
that in order a mixture should be eugenesic the fecundity of the
cross-breed should be <i>absolutely equal</i> to that of individuals
of pure blood. Had it been demonstrated by strict numbers,
that a mixed race, by the simple fact of intermixture breeds
less rapidly than the two parent races, and were it demonstrated
that it presents a greater number of cases of sporadic
sterility, it would by no means result from it that this mixed
race is incapable of maintaining itself and increasing by itself.
The intermixture would cease to be eugenesic if the fact of
sterility became sufficiently general to render the births diminishing
with every new generation, so that at length the gaps
caused by death could no longer be filled and the race would
prove inevitably destined, sooner or later, to become extinct.
Thus, even if it were demonstrated that the offspring of an intermixture
between Celts and Kimris are somewhat less prolific
than the ancestors of the pure races, and that the mixed
populations increased less rapidly than the others; the Kimro-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>Celtic
hybridity would not on that account cease to be eugenesic,
provided the <i>relative</i> sterility did not descend beneath the degree
when the sterility becomes <i>absolute</i>, that is to say, when
the fecundity becomes insufficient. But the departments in
which history and ethnology prove that the intermixture has
been pushed to the extreme point, the population far from
having diminished, has increased since the revolution, namely,
since the establishment of new territorial divisions, as rapidly
as in the rest of France, and it appears to me as certain that
the intermixture of Kimris and Celts either between themselves,
or with the Romans and Germans, constitute examples of
eugenesic hybridity.</p>

<p>We must, however, take care not to imitate the paradoxical
reasoning of our adversaries, and because some crossings of
<i>certain</i> races are eugenesic, to conclude, <i>à priori</i>, that <i>all</i> the
other intermixtures are equally so. The study of hybridity in
birds and quadrupeds has taught us that we can never know
with certainty, before making the experiment, what will be the
result of crossing. Neither must we forget that the ethnological
facts which have served us as examples apply to the intermixture
of races distinct, no doubt, but nearly related in many
respects. The mixture of races more distant from each other,
is it equally prolific, and are the descendants eugenesic?
This is the question we now intend to examine.</p>

<h2>SECTION III.</h2>

<h3 style="visibility: visible; page-break-before: never;">EXAMPLES TENDING TO PROVE THAT THE INTERMIXTURE
OF CERTAIN RACES OF MEN ARE NOT EUGENESIC.<br /><br /></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the first part of this essay we have endeavoured to establish
that certain human cross-breeds possess an unlimited
fecundity, both in their direct alliances and with either of the
parent races, whence we have inferred that eugenesic hybridity
really exists in mankind.</p>

<p>We intend now to investigate the results of certain intermixtures
more disparate, and review a number of facts tending to
the conclusion that all human cross-breeds are not eugenesic.</p>

<p>Let us observe at the outset, how far the phenomena of eugenesic
or non-eugenesic hybridity may affect the solution of
the great question pending between the Monogenists and the
Polygenists.</p>

<p>What in animals in general, characterises the eugenesic
hybridity, is the unlimited fecundity of mongrels of the first
degree between themselves. It is by no means necessary that
the parent species should be as prolific in their crossings as in
their direct unions, nor that the mongrels should be as productive
as their parents, as large, as strong, and as long-lived, etc.
Supposing, for instance, that the she-wolf conceives with more
difficulty with the mastiff than with her proper mate; supposing
even that this crossing is only efficacious by way of exception;
that it succeeds only once out of ten, instead of succeeding
constantly as it occurs in animals of the same species; it would
be sufficient, if in this tenth case the mongrels are very prolific
to pronounce the crossing eugenesic. Supposing also, that the
hybrid wolf-dogs of the first degree produced only litters of about
two or three, that is to say, only half the number usually produced
by she-wolves and bitches, the result would be that this
intermediate race would breed less rapidly by half than the
pure species; but, provided the productiveness of the mongrels
does not descend below the degree necessary for the preserva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>tion
of the species, and provided it can repair the loss at every
generation, the crossing would still be eugenesic, nor would
it cease being so, even if the breed were only half as strong as
their parents, and only half as long-lived.</p>

<h3>Remarks on the interpretation of human hybridity</h3>

<p>When, therefore, a physiologist wishes to demonstrate the
existence of that degree of hybridity which we have termed
eugenesic, he selects two perfectly recognised distinct species
of animals, crosses them, studies their breeds, and if he finds
that they are indefinitely prolific, it is sufficient for him to affirm
the existence of eugenesic hybridity&mdash;that is to say, that the
physiological definition of the <i>species</i> is unacceptable. But
when a zoologist, in studying two races of animals, the specific
determination of which is still contested, endeavours to establish
that these two races are merely varieties of the same
species, and when in order to weaken the differential anatomical
characters pointed out by his adversaries, he invokes the
physiological analogy exhibited by intermixture, we have a
right to expect more than a partial demonstration. We must
first prove that the intermixture of the two races constitutes a
case of eugenesic hybridity; for if the cross-breed are not between
themselves indefinitely prolific, it is certain that the two
races are not of the same species. This first point being established,
would not yet lead to any conclusion, since animals
of different species may engender eugenesic breeds. He must,
therefore, completely analyse all the phenomena of reproduction
and prove that they are exactly the same in the parent
races and in the hybrid race. It is not merely the sexual analogy
but the sexual identity which must be rendered evident;
for from his point of view, it is not sufficient that the two races
in question should be homogenesic in some degree, they must
be entirely homogeneous, and the least genital difference becomes
an argument against the proposition he sustains. If the
cross-breed, though very prolific, are less so than their parents,
or less productive in their crossings than their direct alliances;
or, finally, if the investigation of these crossings exhibits any
functional inequality, it might become very probable that the
two races do not belong to the same species. Such would also
be the case if the cross-breed were less strong and vivacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
than the individuals of the pure race, or if one of the crossings
is more productive than the inverse crossing, as is observed in
certain cases of hybridity, which approach more or less of <i>unilateral
hybridity</i>. The existence of one of these phenomena
might prove that the two races are not homogeneous, and
might lead us to think that they are not of the same species.</p>

<p>The monogenists, who have based the demonstration of the
unity of the human species upon the physiological character of
the prolificacy of the cross-breeds, have not taken into account
these elements. They have confined themselves to the
assertions that all human races can produce cross-breeds, and
that all these breeds are prolific. Now, admitting for a moment
that these assertions are exact, the conclusion they have
drawn from them is still contestable, until they can demonstrate
that the study of these cross-breeds reveals no genital
inequality between the parent races.</p>

<p>But what becomes of their argumentation, if it be proved
that all intermixtures are not eugenistic, that is to say, that
certain mongrels are not between themselves indefinitely prolific;
that other cross-breeds become sterile in the first generation;
and, finally, that certain races are so little homogenesic,
that the birth of cross-breeds of the first degree is more
or less exceptional? If one of these propositions can be effectually
established, the monogenists would have little cause to
congratulate themselves for having appealed to physiology.
They would, on the contrary, have furnished their adversaries
with deadly weapons, and their doctrine would be demolished
on the battle field they have themselves chosen.</p>

<p>The facts I intend to exhibit tend to prove that it was a
great error to consider all intermixtures of men as eugenesic.
Obliged as I am to refer to testimonies which, perhaps, do
not always exhibit a desirable precision, some doubts may
hover over my conclusion; this much, however, will result
from this sketch, that the examination of the laws of hybridity
is far from being favourable to the doctrine of monogenists.</p>

<p>We shall study the cross-breeds both in relation to their
fecundity and their physical and moral validity; for, from our
point of view, it is sufficient to prove that certain cross-breeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
are inferior to the parent races, as regards longevity, vigour,
health, and intelligence, to render it very probable that the
two races are not of the same species.</p>

<h3>Relative infecundity of the interbreeds between the White and Negro</h3>

<p>When a monogenist is called upon to demonstrate that all
human intermixtures are eugenesic, the first example which he
ordinarily cites is that of the Mulattoes in America, the issue
of the union of European colonists and African negresses.
This example, which has for a long time been considered as
decisive, might not be without a reply; for there exist races
differing much more from us than the races of the western
coast of Africa; but the question here is, whether it be quite
true that all American Mulattoes are eugenesic.</p>

<p>We meet, first, with this fact, namely, the union of the
Negro with a white woman is frequently sterile, whilst that of
a white man with a negress is perfectly fecund. This might
tend to establish between these two races a species of hybridity
analogous to that existing between goats and sheep, which we
have termed <i>unilateral hybridity</i>. Professor Serres, fully alive
to the gravity of this fact has given the following explanation:
“One of the characters of the Ethiopian race<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> consists
in the length of the penis compared with that of the Caucasian
race. This dimension coincides with the length of the
uterine canal in the Ethiopian female, and both have their
cause in the form of the pelvis in the Negro race. There
results from this physical disposition, that the union of the
Caucasian man with an Ethiopian woman is easy and without
any inconvenience for the latter. The case is different
in the union of the Ethiopian with a Caucasian woman, who
suffers in the act, the neck of the uterus is pressed against the
sacrum, so that the act of reproduction is not merely painful,
but <i>frequently non-productive</i>.”</p>

<p>This explanation, though based upon an anatomical character
perfectly correct, is yet far from being satisfactory; but
we have quoted it here to show that one of the two most eminent
monogenists of our epoch has admitted as a perfectly authentic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>fact, that the union of Caucasian women with Negroes is very
frequently non-productive.</p>

<p>Mr. Theodore Waitz, author of a scientific treatise on Anthropology
(the first volume is entirely devoted to the study of
general doctrines), has carefully examined the question of the
intermixture of races, and endeavoured to reconcile the results
of these crossings with the system of monogenists. He was,
nevertheless, obliged to admit, from the numerous documents
collected, that in many cases the cross-breeds are feebly constituted,
Thus, in Senegal the offspring of the Foulahs and
the Negroes are handsome and more intelligent than the latter,
but there are amongst them many stammerers, blind, hunchbacks,
and idiots. The children of Arabs and the women of
Darfour are debilitated and little vivacious, and the author adds
<i>that the children of a European woman and a Negro are rarely
vigorous</i>.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>It seems thus to result from these various investigations,
that the union between the Negro and a white woman is little
productive, and that their offspring is neither vigorous nor
vivacious. Nevertheless, we admit this conclusion with some
reserve, because the avowed unions of Negroes with white
women are comparatively rare, and consequently the authors
who have spoken of them could only have their inferences
upon a few facts. The inverse intermixture between the white
man and the negress is, on the contrary, very frequent, and as
prolific in the first generation as in the direct alliances between
individuals of the same race.</p>

<p>It is equally known that Mulattoes and Mulatresses are very
prolific in their recrossings with the parent races. The great
number of individuals of every shade, designated by the name
Quadroon, Quinterons, Tercerons, Griffes, Marabouts, Cabres,
etc., and by the collective name of <i>mixed blood</i>, proves it.
The hybridity of Whites and Negroes is thus, at least, equal to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>what we described in animals by the name of <i>paragenesic hybridity</i>.
The question now arises, whether it be eugenesic,
that is to say, whether Mulattoes and Mulatresses of the first
degree are indefinitely prolific between themselves.</p>

<h3>Relative sterility of some Mulattoes in the first generation</h3>

<p>It would be imprudent to restrict ourselves to superficial
observations, though positive observations are with difficulty
collected. Mulattoes of the first degree are not a well defined
and circumscribed caste, like the whites and negroes of pure
blood. Mulatresses prefer to unite themselves with the white
or with mestizoes whiter than themselves. Mulattoes are thus
frequently obliged to intermix with either pure negresses, or
with mulatresses issued from a recrossing with the Negro race.
There are, nevertheless, a goodly number of unions between
the mestizos of the first degree; but the individuals issued
from these unions have no longer the same chances of intermarrying
as those of the first generation. The number of individuals
of the first degree must, therefore, rapidly decrease
from generation to generation, and the result is, that even if
these cross-breeds were indefinitely prolific between themselves,
we could only, by way of exception, find mulattoes issued in a
direct line to the third or fourth generation, from the direct
and exclusive union of mestizoes of the first degree.</p>

<h3>Moral or physical inferiority of some Mulattoes</h3>

<p>To give to the question at issue a rigorous solution, it is
necessary to study during several generations a population
exclusively composed of mulattoes of the <i>first degree</i>. This
experience can never be obtained. We find, indeed, at Hayti,
a population nearly composed of coloured individuals. But
these coloured men are mestizos of every shade, and if this
hybrid nation were to subsist in perfect prosperity during
several generations, the unlimited prolifickness of mestizos of
the first degree between themselves would not thereby be demonstrated.</p>

<p>We are, then, in default of a physiological experimentation
analogous to what the monogenists require, in attempting to
prove that the crossing of two species of animals is or is not
eugenesic, reduced to the impressions, or rather appreciation
of observers. Most of these appreciations can only be approximatives
wanting a fixed basis. It is absolutely unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
what is the relative proportion of mulattoes of the first degree
who intermarry between themselves, and such who intermix
with other mestizos, or with individuals of a pure race; nor
can we know what, in a given population, should be the normal
proportion of these mulattos if they were perfectly prolific <i>between
themselves</i>. It then becomes very difficult to say whether the
number of mulattoes issued in a direct line from mestizos of
the first degree is equal to the normal proportion, or inferior to it;
so that, if they are but little inferior to their parents in regard to
fecundity, the fact might pass unobserved. The relative sterility
of these breeds would only become evident when it approaches
absolute sterility. Between this degree of prolifickness and
perfect fecundity there are many intermediate degrees, difficult
to recognise, and still more difficult to prove.</p>

<p>The first French observer who has denied the prolifickness of
mulattoes is M. Jacquinot, author of the zoological part of the
<i>Voyage to the South Pole and Oceania</i>. We shall reproduce
here some passages from that work. After having spoken of
the cross-breeds of animals, M. Jacquinot continues in the
following terms:<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>“It is the same in the human genus. There the species are
very approximating, and, according to the principles just laid
down, ‘that the more species are approximating the greater
the chance of fecundity,’ the mestizos issuing from the intermixture
enjoy a certain degree of prolifickness which, however,
as in animals, is not absolute. Like the latter, they return to
the mother’s species in allying themselves with them; and,
independently of their relative fecundity, new individuals are
constantly produced by the union of the parent races.</p>

<p>“On observing in our colonies that a population of mulattos
is constantly produced and renewed, their fecundity was not
doubted; yet it is very limited. On the one hand the mulattos
disappear every moment in one or the other of the parent
races, and if their unions were constantly between themselves,
they would not be long before becoming extinct....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>
<p>“In a colony, that is to say in an island, or a part of a
continent of limited extent peopled by Negroes and white men
for some centuries, the greater part of the population should
be composed of mulattoes....</p>

<p>“But it is not so, and whatever be the number of mulattoes
in the colonies, the predominance of the Negro and Caucasian
species is not less certain.... There is, besides, a fact known
to persons inhabiting the colonies, that the white women and
the negresses are very prolific, which is not the case with the
mulatresses.</p>

<p>“We believe to be the first who has pointed out the sterility
in human cross-breeds. We have not been able to collect
precise and positive observations based on figures; but we
think that the figures will be soon forthcoming now that the
attention of observers is drawn to the subject.”</p>

<p>The avowal which terminates this passage, much diminishes
its importance. M. Jacquinot, not having sojourned long in
the various countries he visited, was only able to collect superficial
observations in regard to a question which requires long
and minute researches. But Mr. Nott, one of the most eminent
anthropologists of America, was in a better condition to study
this subject.</p>

<p>Living in a country where the Caucasian and Ethiopian
races are much mixed, and enabled by his profession as a physician
to make his observations on a great number of individuals,
he arrived at conclusions similar to those of M. Jacquinot.
His first essay on hybridity appeared in 1842. It was but a
short paper, which attracted but little notice, and which we
have not been able to consult, no copy of it being in the Paris
library. M. Jacquinot, whose work appeared in 1846, had
certainly no knowledge of this essay, his observations having
been made in 1836-40, before M. Nott had published his own.
We are not, however, engaged here to discuss the question of
priority, we state merely the fact that two distinguished observers
studying the same subject, unknown to each other,
arrived at the same conclusions relating to the sterility of
Mulattoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>In his essay of 1812, Dr. Nott maintained the following propositions,
which we extract from a subsequent publication.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>1. That <i>Mulattoes</i> are the shortest lived of any class of the
human race.</p>

<p>2. That <i>Mulattoes</i> are intermediate in intelligence between
the blacks and the whites.</p>

<p>3. That they are less capable of undergoing fatigue and
hardships than either the blacks or whites.</p>

<p>4. That the <i>Mulatto-women</i> are peculiarly delicate, and subject
to a variety of chronic diseases. That they are bad breeders,
bad nurses, liable to abortions, and that their children generally
die young.</p>

<p>5. That when <i>Mulattoes</i> intermarry, they are less prolific
than when crossed on the parent stock.</p>

<p>6. That when a <i>Negro</i> man married a white woman, the offspring
partook more largely of the Negro type than when the
reverse connection had effect.</p>

<p>7. That Mulattoes, like Negroes, although unacclimated,
enjoy extraordinary exemption from yellow-fever when brought
to Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, or New Orleans.</p>

<p>The propositions, 1, 3, 4, and 5, are the only ones connected
with our subject. They confirm, and even enhance, in certain
respects, M. Jacquinot’s assertions, yet are they contested,
and Dr. Nott himself has found it necessary to restrict their
application. He had made his observations in South Carolina
where he found the Mulattoes little prolific and short-lived.
Having changed his residence, he obtained different results.
At Mobile, New Orleans, Pensacola, towns on the Gulf of
Mexico, he found among the Mulattoes many instances of
manifest longevity and prolificacy, not merely in their crossed
but in their direct alliances. What was the cause of this difference?
Dr. Nott inquired whether the difference in the results
might not depend upon the difference in the ethnological
elements in the crossing. All the Europeans who have colonised
America did not belong to the same race. The Caucasians,
as is well known, are naturally divided in two groups:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>the
light-haired race, with grey or blue eyes, a white skin; and
the brown races, with a deeper complexion and brown or black
hair. The first occupy Northern Europe; the second, Southern
Europe. There is thus a little less disparity, and a little
more affinity between the Europeans of the South and the
Negroes, than between the latter and the Northern Europeans,
so that when we hear that intermixture succeeds better in the
first than in the second case, it should not surprise us. But
South Carolina, where the Mulattoes get on so indifferently, has
been colonised by the Anglo-Saxons; whilst the shores of the
Gulf of Mexico, where the Mulattoes are more prospering, have
been colonised by the French (Louisiana) and by the Spaniards
(Florida). Such is the explanation offered by Dr. Nott. Still
in maintaining his conclusions on the issues of Negro women,
and men of the Germanic race, he thinks that they are not applicable
to the Mulattoes whose parents belong to a Caucasian
race more or less dark in complexion. Analogous differences
are often observed in animals in such crossings when they are
placed in connections with species more or less approximate.
Before, however, accepting Dr. Nott’s explanation, it may be
as well to examine whether the fact may not be differently explained.</p>

<p>South Carolina, comprised between 32° and 35° N. lat., is
situated beyond the zone where the African Negroes live: New
Orleans, Mobile, and Pensacola are situated nearer the tropics,
between the 30° and 31°, and we find in Africa, in Northern
Sahara, south of Algiers, some tribes of Negroes who have lived
in that latitude from time immemorial. Though the climate
does not altogether depend on latitude, it may be readily believed
that the Negroes become sooner acclimated upon the
shores of the Gulf of Mexico than in the more northern regions.
But it is known that men transplanted into climates differing
much from that in which their race thrives may, by this simple
fact, greatly lose their fecundity. It is not always so, but considering
that it does happen, we have a right to ask whether
the difference pointed out by Dr. Nott between the Mulattoes
of South Carolina, and those of the region of the Gulf may
not be owing to this cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>This interpretation is, however, in opposition to two orders
of facts. On the one hand, the Negroes and Negresses of
South Carolina are perfectly prolific between themselves.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
The climate of that country has not weakened their generative
powers, and there is no reason why, by their alliances with a
white race acclimated in that part, there should be produced an
offspring less acclimated than their parents. The diminished
vitality and fecundity can, therefore, not be attributed to the
influence of the media in which they are brought up.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a result similar to that mentioned by
Nott, as regards South Carolina, seems to have been obtained
in Jamaica under the 18°, corresponding nearly to the latitude
of Senegal and Timbuctoo. This island is situated
south of Cuba, Hayti, and Porto Rico, where Negroes and
Mulattoes thrive, but these islands have been colonised by the
French and the Spaniards, whilst Jamaica is an <i>English</i> colony.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>The Mulattoes of Jamaica have thus the same ethnologic
origin as those of Carolina; and the following remarks from
the <i>History of Jamaica</i>, by Long, entirely confirm Nott’s
opinion.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>“The Mulattoes of Jamaica,” says Long, “are generally
well proportioned, and the Mulatto women have fine features,
and seem to have more of the White than of the Negro in
their blood. Some of them have married women of their own
colour, but these marriages are generally sterile. They seem
in this respect to resemble certain mules, being less capable of
producing between themselves than with the Whites or Blacks.
Some instances may possibly have occurred, where, upon the
intermarriage of two Mulattoes, the woman has borne children,
which children have grown to maturity; <i>but I never heard of
such an instance</i>.</p>

<p>“Those Mulattoes of Jamaica, of which I speak, have married
young, have received some education, and are distinguished
by their chaste and regular conduct. The observations
made regarding them have a great degree of certainty. They
do not breed, though there is nothing to indicate that they
would not be prolific by intermarrying either with the Blacks
or Whites.</p>

<p>“In searching for facts contrary to this opinion, it is requisite
to discard the suspicion that the Mulatress has had intercourse
with any other man than her Mulatto husband, and
there would still remain the question, whether the son of
a Mulatto, married to the daughter of two other Mulattoes, is
capable of producing and forming a durable race.”</p>

<p>Such a grave fact could not be allowed to pass unchallenged.
Professor Waitz, much embarrassed by it, could only oppose to
it a passage extracted from a work published in 1845 by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>Lewis, <i>On the Negroes in the West Indies</i>. “Lewis,” says
Waitz (<i>Anthropologie der Naturvölker</i>), “expressly denies the
sterility of the Mulattoes of Jamaica in their marriages between
themselves, and observes, that they are as prolific as the Blacks
and Whites, but that they are for the most part flabby and
weak, and their children have little vitality.”</p>

<p>Long said he knew of no instance where the children of
Mulattoes arrived at maturity. To refute this assertion, known
instances should have been cited. But Lewis neglects doing
so.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> He says, on the contrary, that the children, from similar
marriages, possess little vitality. Though this expression does
not necessarily imply the impossibility of arriving at adult
age, it tends at least to the conclusion that the children have
little chance to reach it; and when we consider that the preceding
passage was intended to refute Long’s assertions, it is
surprising how little satisfies Professor Waitz. At any rate, it
proves that he could find no other positive document in opposition
to the fact mentioned by Long.</p>

<p>This is, perhaps, no reason for accepting without reserve
the opinions of Dr. Nott. Before giving a definite judgment,
we must wait for further numerous, authentic, and scientific
observations. Nevertheless, it must be remarked, that the
indefinite fecundity of Mulattoes had been admitted as an
axiom, which it was thought there was no necessity of disproving.
It was sufficient to say there are many Mulattoes,
without investigating whether they maintain themselves, or by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>continuous intermixture with the parent stocks. The first
who wished to inquire more closely has, by his observations,
been led to results opposed to general opinion. To these observations,
presenting apparently the guarantee of authenticity,
positive observation should be opposed; and it is requisite
that the latter should be specially collected in countries where
the <i>Germanic</i> race has intermarried with the Negro race of
Western Africa. The investigations which might be made in
the French, Spanish, or Portuguese colonies would have no
direct application.</p>

<p>The authors, moreover, we have cited, are far from being
the only ones who have denied the fecundity of the Mulattoes
in the West Indies. Van Amringe and Hamilton Smith assert,
that without a reunion with the parent stocks the Mulattoes
would soon become extinct. Day says that Mulattoes are
rarely prolific between themselves; and Waitz, somewhat
shaken by these testimonies, adds in a note, “The sterility of
Mulattoes, when it is complete, may be compared with that
fact recognised by Wirgman in plants, that the hybrids of
intermediate types between the two parent stocks are sterile,
whilst those resembling one or the other species are prolific.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
From these facts and testimonies there seems to result&mdash;1.
That the Mulattoes of the Germanic and Ethiopian races possess
little prolificacy: 2. That they are inferior in this respect
to the Mulattoes born by the intercourse of Negro women and
men belonging to the more or less dark complexioned Caucasian
races.</p>

<p>Mulattoes of the latter kind exist in large numbers in the
greater part of the Antilles, South America, Central America,
Mexico, Mauritius, Bourbon, and Senegal. All these countries
have been colonised by the French, Spaniards, or Portuguese.
The Mulattoes born there are fecund in their intermixture
with the parent stock, as the Mulattoes of Germanic origin;
they are also prolific between themselves, at least in the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>generation. Are they equally prolific in their direct alliances
as in their mixed ones? Are their children arriving at maturity
as the others? And finally, when these children intermarry,
are they and their descendants prolific? These questions
are yet unanswered. They can only be solved after a
long series of observations collected by men of science; not
by travellers who view the populations superficially, but by
close observers, and principally by physicians resident in these
localities. In the mean while, here is another passage from
the work of Prof. Waitz, quoted by him from Seemann.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> “The
Mulattoes of the Negroes and Whites at Panamá are prolific
between themselves, but their children are brought up with
difficulty; whilst the families of the pure races produce less
children, which however arrive at maturity.” The Europeans
of Panamá are of Spanish origin. The prolifickness of the
Mulattoes of the first degree is clearly indicated in this passage,
but doubts may be entertained as to the fecundity of
their descendants. The intermixtures of Negroes and Europeans
are not the only ones the results of which exhibit defects
to the observers. “The Mulattoes,” says M. Boudin,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> “are
very often inferior to the two parent stocks, both in vitality,
intelligence, or morality. Thus the Mulattoes of Pondicherry,
known by the name of Topas, exhibit a mortality not only
more considerable than that of the Indians, but greater than
the Europeans, though the latter are considerably shorter lived
in India than in Europe. Positive documents on this point
have been published in the <i>Revue Coloniale</i>. So much as to
the vitality.</p>

<p>“In Java, the Mulattoes of the Dutch and Malays are so
little intelligent that they could never be employed as functionaries.
All Dutch historians are agreed upon this point.
This much for their intelligence.</p>

<h3>Malay and mixed breeds</h3>

<p>“The Mulattoes of Negroes and Indians, known by the
name of <i>Zambos</i> in Peru and Nicaragua, form the worst class
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>of citizens. They compose four-fifths of the prison population.
This fact, already mentioned by Tschudi,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> has recently
been confirmed by Squier. So much as regards morality.</p>

<p>“There are, however, certain physical qualities which may
be acquired by the intermixture of races. Such are pathological
immunities. The Mulattoes of the West Indies are, like
the Negroes, exempt from the yellow fever.”</p>

<p>The fecundity of Mulattoes is not touched in this passage,
not having been the subject of discussion. The question
merely was whether the prevalent opinion, that intermixture
of improved races physically, intellectually, and morally, was
in accordance with well observed facts. Hence, M. Boudin
confined his observations to the limited intelligence exhibited
by the Mulattoes issued from the union of the Dutch of Java
with the Malay women. But in his <i>Treatise on Medical Geography</i>,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
he expresses, with regard to the Mulattoes, an opinion
that they are not productive beyond the third generation.
This fact, announced by Dr. Yvan, which is confirmed by other
testimonies, has not been contested. Waitz borrows from
Graf Görtz some particulars which are not without interest.</p>

<p>“The Lipplappen,” he says (this is the name of the Mulattoes
of Java), “do not breed beyond the third generation.
Flabby and weakly, they become developed up to the fifteenth
year, when the development is arrested. At the third generation,
girls only are born, which are sterile.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> This phase of
sterility is very curious, and deserves well the attention of
physiologists.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>It is, however, necessary to inquire whether the sterility of
the Lipplappen depends upon intermixture or upon other
causes. The climate of the islands of the Sunda straits is very
injurious to Europeans. The Dutch do not perpetuate their
race at Batavia; and even without intermarrying with the
natives they become sometimes sterile at the second generation.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
The sterility of the natives may, then, be attributed to
the climate. These results, moreover prove, from a verbal communication
of Dr. Yvan to M. de Quatrefages, that in other
Dutch colonies of the Great Indian Archipelago, the Mulattoes
are prolific.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> It is thus not demonstrated that the sterility of
the Lipplappen is the result of their hybridity.</p>

<p>M. de Quatrefages, in order to explain the difference of results
produced by the intermixture of the Dutch and the Malays
at Java, and other Dutch colonies, supposes that this difference
is due to the influence of mediums. This is possible; but
there are other influences which must be taken into account,
namely, the numerical proportion of either of the two races
who intermarry. Where the Europeans are few in number,
the Mulattoes of the first degree are also very few; those who
intermarry between themselves are still less numerous, and the
rest ally themselves with the parent stock, chiefly with the indigenous
race, which is preponderating. Where, on the contrary,
the European population is considerable, the Mulattoes
of the first degree are sufficiently numerous to constitute a
sort of intermediate caste, which, without altogether escaping
a recrossing, contract nearly all their alliances with their
equals.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> In the first case, most individuals of mixed blood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>approximate more to the indigenous race than to the foreign;
that is to say, that the Mulattoes of the second, third degree,
etc., are much more numerous than the Mulattoes of the first
degree. But in proportion as a recrossing is effected, the influence
of hybridity diminishes, and becomes effaced. In the
second case, on the contrary, the greater part of the Mulattoes
are of the first degree,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> and, much more than the rest, subject
to the influence of hybridity; and if it be true that hybridity
causes a diminution of fecundity, it is easily understood that
the prolificness must vary according to the relative proportion
of the two races. Now, Batavia is the great centre of the
population of the India Archipelago; there the Europeans are
most numerous; it is chiefly there that the Lipplappen form a
distinct class, and it is precisely there that their defective prolificness
is found. I do not pretend to say that this interpretation
is perfectly correct; I merely advance it as an hypothesis
to be verified. Here, however, we have a fact which
may enhance its value. I borrow it from the work of Prof.
Waitz. It is known that a large number of Chinese are found
in the eastern and western isles of the Indian Archipelago.
They are relatively less numerous in Java and Sumatra, where
their commerce cannot sustain the competition with the Dutch.
“The descendants of the Chinese and the Malay women in
the eastern islands of the Indian Archipelago,” says Waitz,
“soon become extinct; whilst at Java, <i>where the pure Chinese
are few in number</i>. The Malay-Chinese Mulattoes amount to
200,000.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>If the defective fecundity of the Lipplappen of Java is due
to the deleterious influence of climate, it is very difficult to
attribute the great prolificness of the Malay-Chinese to the
benignity of the same climate. Moreover, the more eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>islands, where the latter Mulattoes do not thrive, are more
unhealthy than Java. There seems, therefore to result, from
the facts quoted by Waitz, that the Malay-Chinese thrive
where the Chinese are few in number, and that they decay
where the Chinese are numerous; that is to say, that the
fecundity of the hybrid population augments in proportion as
the conditions favourable to a return crossing with the Malay
race are present. This amounts to the same thing, namely,
that the Mulattoes of the second, third, and fourth degree are
more prolific than those of the first, which certainly corresponds
with the laws of hybridity among animals. These facts, however,
require to be verified and completed before they can serve
as a basis to arrive at a definite conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>These examples of the Mulattoes of Malasia, which we
accept with reserve, tend to demonstrate that the results of
intermixture do not exclusively depend on the degree of
proximity of race; for there is certainly a less zoological
distance between the Chinese and the Malays, and between
the Malays and the Dutch, than between the African Negroes
and the South Europeans. Yet the Mulattoes of the French,
Portuguese, and Spanish colonies seem gifted with a much
greater prolificacy than the Dutch or Chinese Mulattoes of
Malasia. It is besides known that in Mexico and South
America the union of the indigenous population between the
Portuguese or the Spaniards has, in many localities, produced
Mulattoes, the race of which seems to perpetuate itself.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>In investigating hybridity in animals, we have found that
homœogenesis is not always exactly proportional to the degree
of proximity of species; we would especially point out that
the <i>chabeins</i>, or hybrids of the goat and the sheep, are superior
to the mules of the ass and the mare, though there is a greater
difference between goats and sheep than between the horse
and the ass.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> It is not less true that in general, though with
some exceptions, the results of intermixture are more defective
in proportion as the species are more distant from each other.
This leads us to study human hybridity in such regions where
the most elevated races have come into contact with the most
inferior races. What are the two races forming the extremes
of the human species? Several English authors express the
conviction that the Anglo-Saxon, or rather the Germanic race,
to which they belong, is the first race of humanity. M. Alex.
Harvey is even pleased to believe that Providence has created
it to rule all the rest.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> Patriotism is a virtue which is entitled
to our esteem. We shall, therefore, not attempt diminishing
the satisfaction of our allies across the straits, and we shall, at
any rate, acknowledge that the race which has produced a
Leibnitz and a Newton is inferior to none.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<h3>Relative sterility of the interbreeds between the Europeans and the Australians or Tasmanians</h3>

<p>At the extremity of the world, and nearly at the antipodes
of Great Britain, the English have been for more than half a
century in contact with the Melanesian races, and specially
with the Australians and Tasmanians. The relative degree of
inferiority between these latter races, which differ sensibly in
their physical character, may be open to discussion.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> It is,
however, generally admitted that they are inferior at least
to all other races who have come in permanent contact with
Europeans. The Hottentot race, which has long been considered
to occupy the lowest degree, is evidently superior to
them. The Hottentots, though refractory to education, have,
at least, shown some degree of improvability, while the
Australians seem absolutely incorrigible savages. The English
have made the most persevering attempts to instruct them,
but without any success. As they could not succeed with the
adult population, they tried it with children of a tender age,
and educated them with European children in orphan asylums;
they have there learned to mumble some prayers, even to read
and write; but, with approaching puberty, the young pupils
succumbed to their savage instincts, and escaped into the
woods to live again with their parents whom they had never
known. At one time young Australians were transported to
England, and confided to the Moravian brothers, who neglected
no cares to improve them. “They have returned as brutish
as they were before,” says M. Garnat; “a proprietor of a farm
in the interior assured me, that he could never succeed to
employ them in the most simple agricultural labour.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>What is known of the Tasmanians scarcely permits us to
consider them superior to the Australians. It must, however,
be admitted that those unfortunate islanders of Van Diemen’s
Land have not been so much attended to as the Australians.
The English, so humane and patient as regards the latter,
have committed upon the Tasmanian race, and that in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>nineteenth century, execrable atrocities a hundred times less
excusable than the hitherto unrivalled crimes of which the
Spaniards were guilty in the fifteenth century in the Antilles.</p>

<p>These atrocities have terminated in a regular extermination,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
caused, say the optimists, by the absolute unsociability
of the Tasmanians.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> This is not, in our opinion, a mitigatory
circumstance, but from all these facts there results evidently,
that, of all human beings, the Tasmanians are, or rather were,
with the Australians, nearest to the brutal condition.</p>

<p>The investigation of the results obtained from the intermixture
of Anglo-Saxons with these inferior races, may give
us an idea what the crossing between the two most disparate
branches of the human family may produce.</p>

<p>M. Omalius d’Halloy, President of the Belgian Senate, a
venerable scholar, as well known for his geological as for his
anthropological works, thus concludes the seventh chapter of
his <i>Treatise on the Races of Man</i>: “It is remarkable that,
though a considerable number of Europeans now inhabit the
same countries as the Andamenes, no mention is made of the
existence of hybrids resulting front their union.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>name of Andamenes, d’Halloy comprises the Australians, Tasmanians,
and all the blacks with woolly hair of Melanesia and
Malasia.</p>

<p>It may, then, be inferred from this passage, either that the
Europeans established in these countries have no connection
with the native black women, which appears inadmissible, as
we shall presently show, or that the intermixture between the
two races is perfectly sterile. This latter assertion is, however,
not altogether correct. True it is that the greater part
of travellers make no mention whatever of hybrids of Melanesia;
it is equally true that they are very rare, but still there
exist some. Thus Quoy and Gaymard have seen <i>one</i> hybrid of an
European and a Tasmanian woman.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> Mr. Gliddon, who unfortunately
does not cite the source from which he has drawn
his information, announces that until the year 1835, when the
Tasmanians were exterminated, there were only known, in the
whole of Tasmania, two adult Mulattoes.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> This indicates
either that few were born, or that they died at an early age,
for the colony, founded in 1803 by a population at first almost
<i>exclusively masculine</i>, had, in a few years, considerably increased
by the arrival of convicts and free settlers, nearly all
males. Mr. Jacquinot, after having announced that there were
no hybrids in Australia, adds, “In Hobart Town, and in all
Tasmania, there are no hybrids either.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> No other author
has, to our knowledge, mentioned Tasmanian hybrids.</p>

<p>The intermixture of the English with the native women of
Australia has not been more productive. “There are scarcely,”
says Jacquinot, “any Mulattoes of Australians and English
mentioned.” This absence of Mulattoes between two peoples
living in contact on the same soil, proves incontestably the
difference of species. It may also be noticed that if such
cross-breeds really existed, they would be easily recognised.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
Mr. Lesson, who lived about two months in Sydney and its
environs, and who made several excursions among the natives,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>mentions only one cross-breed, the offspring of a white man
and the wife of a chief named Bongari.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Cunningham, a great
defender of the Australian race&mdash;which, by the way, has
finished by killing, and it is even said eating him&mdash;has written
two volumes on New South Wales, in which neither directly nor
indirectly is there mention made of more than one single Mulatto,
and it happens that this single Mulatto is precisely the same
of whom Mr. Lesson speaks.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> No statistical writer, nor any
historian, enumerates cross-breeds among the Australian population.
No where, nevertheless, are the classes of society
more numerous and more distinct. The officials, the colonists
born in Europe, the colonists born in Australia, the convicts,
the emancipated, the descendants of convicts, etc.; form as
many classes envious of and despising each other, they dispute
their respective privileges, and give each other more or less picturesque
nick names. There are sterlings, currencies,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> the legitimate,
the illegitimate,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> the pure Merinos, the convicts, the
titled, the untitled, the canaries, the government men, the bushrangers,
the emancipists,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and some other classes of immigrants
or convicts. In this rich vocabulary there is not a single word
to designate the Mulattoes. Yet in all countries where races of
different colours mix, the language of the locality contains
always distinct denominations for Mulattoes of various shades.
Nothing of the kind exists in Australia. There is even a class
of white men, the <i>legitimates</i>, which have also the name of
<i>cross-breeds</i>.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> This word everywhere else would designate Mulattoes,
in Australia it means European convicts, it being
thought impossible that the rare issue of an intermixture be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>tween
the two races should ever become a part of the population.</p>

<p>It is, however, not merely in New South Wales that we are
struck with the paucity of cross-breeds between Europeans and
Australians; Mr. McGillivray mentions a similar fact as regards
the port of Essingen, an English colony of Northern
Australia.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>We may, therefore, accept as an authenticated fact, that the
cross-breeds between Europeans and native women are very
rare in Australia, as they were in Tasmania when the Tasmanian
race existed.</p>

<p>This fact is so much in opposition to the general opinion on
the intermixture of human races, that before attributing it to
physiological causes, we must inquire whether it is not owing
to some other causes.</p>

<p>We might be tempted, for instance, to suppose, that there
was no intermixture, and that the ugliness and dirty habits of
the native women bridled the sexual desire of the Europeans.
This has been advanced, not by travellers who have precisely
asserted the contrary, but by honest and sensible reasoners,
whose refined taste revolted at the aspect of the portraits and
busts of the Australian women. It would be a serious fact
that a whole race should have such an irresistible repugnance
to another, for nature has only inspired with such a feeling of
repulsion beings of different species, and man is certainly of all
animals the least exclusive. Is there in our seaports a prostitute
sufficiently ugly and old to frighten the sailor? Is it
not known that the Hottentots, whose ugliness is proverbial,
have intermixed with the Europeans of South Africa? We
must then set aside such a supposition, which is not founded
upon a correct knowledge of human nature. There are, moreover,
some documents, which induce us to believe that the
Europeans of Australia and Van Diemen’s Land have intermixed
with the native women.</p>

<p>According to Malte-Brun the population of the colony of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Sydney amounted in 1821 to 37,068 individuals, thus distributed.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>Thus there were among the free adults only twenty-seven
women for a hundred men, that is to say, that seventy-three
men in a hundred were absolutely prevented from marrying.</p>

<p>The relative proportion of convicts of the two sexes is not
indicated in the above account, but it is known that originally
the male convicts formed the great majority, and that
there were ever afterwards far fewer women than men.</p>

<p>In 1825<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> the number of inhabitants amounted to nearly
50,000; but from this period the convicts were mostly sent to
Van Diemen’s Land, and the white population of Australia
diminished rapidly from not receiving regular reinforcements.
In 1836 there were only 36,598 of all classes.</p>

<p>There were thus, among the convicts, only one woman to nine
men, and among the free population one woman to two men.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>Hence may be explained the small increase of the population
during the first periods of the colony and the considerable decrease
which corresponds to the period from 1825 to 1830.
In 1845, according to Henricq,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> New South Wales had, since
its foundation, already received 90,000 convicts of both sexes,
beyond an unknown but considerable number of voluntary emigrants,
yet the whole population consisted only of 85,000 individuals.
At the same period there were in the free class
but three females to five males, and among the convicts one
woman to twelve men. In the colony of Hobart Town, in Tasmania,
the disproportion was somewhat less, for there were
five free females to seven males, and one female convict to
twelve men.</p>

<p>It is difficult to believe that the free men deprived of women
were all gifted with the virtue of continency. But admitting
this for a moment, we cannot entertain the same opinion with
regard to the convicts, which are certainly not chosen from the
most virtuous classes of Great Britain. It must be noticed
that the female convicts are not public women in the colony.
The government accords certain advantages to convicts who
contract legitimate marriages; this is the first step towards
their liberation, and when a vessel arrives with a cargo of
females they are readily espoused by the convicts. Nine-tenths,
therefore, of the latter are entirely deprived of white
women. On the other hand they procure <i>gins</i> (the name of
Australian females) with the greatest facility, and though it
may not be known that many of them cohabit with the females,
it may be easily divined and affirmed. “The women of the
people of Port Jackson,” says Lesson, “look out for and excite
the white men, and prostitute themselves for <i>a glass of
brandy</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>After observing that these tribes live chiefly from the produce
of the chase, and come to town to exchange their fish for
fish-hooks, bread, or rum, Cunningham adds that this trade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>gives rise to scenes of debauchery, that the prostitution of
native females with the whites had assumed considerable proportions,
“considering that the Australians lend their women
to the convicts for a slice of bread or a pipe of tobacco.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> It
is useless to cite other testimony after the chief defender of the
Australian race has thus expressed himself.</p>

<p>It is thus perfectly certain that numerous alliances have taken
place and are taking place between the Europeans and the native
women. The inhabitants of the colony, who could not but be
aware of it, have had recourse to a singular hypothesis, accepted
by Cunningham and recently by Waitz. They have imagined
that the Australian husbands, excited by jealousy, killed all the
new-born children of mixed blood; and to these hypothetical
massacres (of which there is no proof whatever) they attribute
the rarity of cross-breeds. In order that this tale should
acquire some probability, it is first requisite that all the Australian
women should be under the dominion of jealous and
ferocious husbands, and that none of the females had the maternal
instinct sufficiently developed to save her child from the
fury of her husband. Cunningham, in accepting this explanation,
forgets that he in the same page relates that the Australians
prostitute their <i>gins</i> to the first comer for a pipe of
tobacco. Such beings would not feel themselves much dishonoured
by the birth of the strange child. But here is an instance
proving that the Australians are not altogether devoid of
humour; showing, at least, that they have no notion of conjugal
honour. Bongarri, of whom we have already spoken,
and who in 1825 was the most celebrated chief of the Australian
hordes of Port Jackson, treated as his son the offspring of
the adulterous intercourse of his <i>gin</i> with a convict of the place.
When he was asked how it came to pass that his son had such
a fair complexion, he replied jocularly, “that his wife was very
fond of white bread and had partaken too much of it.” He
invariably returned the same answer to inquirers.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> If a war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>rior
chief covered with honourable scars<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> attaches such small
importance to the fidelity of his wife, and jokes about his dishonour,
it is scarcely admissible that the men of his tribe should
be more susceptible in this respect. Yet this very chief found
it, according to Cunningham,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> quite natural that, according to
the Australian custom, the weakest of two new-born twins
should be killed.</p>

<p>This custom has been cited to show that the Australian women
attach no importance to the lives of their children, and
that, consequently, they would offer no resistance to the massacre
of the new-born Mulattoes. A race of beings, where the
females do not love their young, would scarcely be a human
race. The custom of preserving only one twin, and to sacrifice
the other on the day of its birth, seems improbable and inexplicable;
but taking into consideration the famishing condition
of the Australians, the uncertainty and the insufficiency of
their alimentation, the absolute want of social organisation,
and the material difficulty attending the bringing up of only
one child, it may be imagined that the mother, incapable, perhaps,
of suckling one baby, resigns herself to sacrificing one
child to save the other. There is, therefore, no absolute
parallel between the custom in regard to twins and that of the
pretended massacre of cross-breeds. If it be still supposed
that the natives of the environs of Sydney, perverted by their
intercourse with convicts, and exasperated by their violence,
have adopted this revolting habit, we should even then only
admit that such a degradation is merely local in its application.
Certain abominations spread from place to place, and
are transmitted from people to people; but a usage so contrary
to natural instinct, does not arise simultaneously, and under the
same form in different parts of a country. The Australians,
however, of Sydney, have no means of transmitting their customs
either to the natives of Tasmania, or of Port Essington in
North Australia. Dr. Waitz supposes that even seven hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>miles from Sydney the natives sacrifice all young Mulattoes.
This supposition is rather hazardous, specially as the traveller
whom he quotes merely says that these Mulattoes do not appear
to be capable of development.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>We conclude from this perhaps too lengthy discussion, that
the murder of the Australian Mulattoes is a vulgar tale. Admitting
that such murders occur occasionally, or even that they
are frequent, there should even then be many Mulattoes in
Australia provided the intermixture be very prolific. We can
in the above strange explanation only find a confirmation, and
a very strong one too, of the fact we have established, namely,
that the cross-breeds are rare in Australia. If this fact had
not been perfectly evident, there would not have been any occasion
to explain it, and Mr. Cunningham, who has made such
strenuous efforts to reinstate the natives, would not have
charged them with such a terrible accusation.</p>

<p>We have not exhausted the list of hypotheses advanced, to
explain the nearly constant sterility attending the intercourse
between Australians and Tasmanians and the English. It has
also been said that for the most part the intercourse between
the two races was accidental, momentary, and that consequently
the native woman has a much greater chance to become pregnant
by her savage husband than by her European lovers, and
that the rarity of Australian Mulattoes had no other cause.
M. de Freycinet seems to have accepted this explanation.
“No <i>permanent</i> alliances are formed between the two peoples,
though we find here and there some Mulattoes; but these are
merely the result of some transitory connections of Europeans
with Australian women.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<h3>Observations of Count Strzelecki; discussion</h3>

<p>We would first observe that the number of mongrels is in
many countries much more considerable, if the intermixture is
effected in the same manner as is notably the case in South
Africa. There are cross-breeds in several of the Polynesian
Islands, where the Europeans have never permanently settled,
but only appeared temporarily. There should, therefore, be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>good number of them in the Australian colonies, even if it
were true that the Whites have never formed a permanent alliance
with the native females. It can, however, not be doubted,
that more or less enduring alliances have taken place between
the two races, namely, that many Whites have kept for months
and years Australian concubines under their roof.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> This fact
positively results from the controversy raised by Count Strzelecki.
This celebrated traveller, who has visited America and
Oceania, remarked that the native women, after having once
lived with the white race, become sterile with the men of their
own race, though they may still be capable of becoming pregnant
by white men. He asserts that he has collected hundreds
of such cases among the Hurons, Seminoles, Araucaños, Polynesians,
and Melanesians. He does not attempt to explain
this strange phenomenon, which, he observes, is owing to some
mysterious law, and which appears to him to be one of the
causes of the rapid decay of indigenous populations in regions
occupied by Europeans.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>Mr. Alex. Harvey says that Professors Goodsir, Maunsel,
and Carmichael have, from various sources, ascertained that
Count Strzelecki’s assertion is <i>unquestionable</i>, and must be
considered as the expression of a law of nature.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>M. de Strzelecki has not specified that the sterilisation of
the native females was the consequence of the procreation of
cross-breeds. He merely speaks of sexual relations in general;
and it appears to result from the text, that a native woman
who has cohabited for some time with a European, becomes
sterile in the intercourse with men of her own race, even if she
has not produced a child.</p>

<p>It has, however, been assumed that this observer speaks
only of such women who have at least once been impregnated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>by a European, and it is in this form that the question has
been examined by physiologists. The question has been
asked, how the gestation of a Mulatto’s fœtus could modify
the constitution of the mother to render her barren with the
men of her own race; and Mr. Alex. Harvey,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> in developing a
theory of Mr. McGillivray, has supposed that the embryo,
whilst in utero, subjected the mother, by some sort of inoculation,
to organic or dynamic modifications, the elements of
which had been transmitted to the embryo by the father, and
the mother would then retain the impress permanently. In
support of this hypothesis, the author reminds us that certain
diseases, such as old and non-contagious syphilis, may be communicated
to the mother by the mediation of the fœtus. He
further observes that in horses, oxen, sheep, and dogs, a
female, impregnated for the first time by a male, may for a
long time preserve a certain disposition to produce with another
male young resembling the first, a phenomenon well-known
to breeders. He finally remarks that a mare, having
given birth to a mule, conceives subsequently with greater difficulty
from horses than from asses, and he connects these instances
with those of the native women who once impregnated
by a white man, become by it barren in their connexion with
men of their own race without, however, losing the capacity of
becoming again pregnant by white men.</p>

<p>I cannot accept this adventurous theory which Dr. Carpenter
was nearly ready to adopt, but which he has discarded in a
postscript, owing to fresh information which he received while
his article went to press.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> The influence of the first male
upon the succeeding progeny has been many times rendered
evident by the crossing of animals of the same race, and even
of different species.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> The existence of such a phenomenon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>in the human species is, at any rate, still doubtful, and the
connexion of facts of this kind, with Strzelecki’s assertion, is
yet more questionable. We must also observe that Strzelecki,
in pointing out the barrenness of savage women who have cohabited
with the Whites, does not merely speak of such who
have produced Mulattoes, but applies equally to those women
who had not given birth to any children; and if Mr. Harvey
had taken the exact meaning of the text, he might, perhaps,
not have advanced his theory.</p>

<p>The observations of M. de Strzelecki, though made in various
regions, have been published in a work on Australia. It was
thought that he spoke especially of the native women of New
South Wales, and it was more from that country that more information
was expected on that subject. Mr. Heywood Thomson,
a surgeon of the English navy, took up the question, and
sent to the <i>Edinburgh Monthly Journal</i> an article tending to
refute Strzelecki’s assertion. This article effectively shows
that Strzelecki’s opinion was far too general. The author
states, that he had known a colonist of the Macquarie river,
who communicated to him the following fact:&mdash;One of his
convict servants had a child born him by an Australian woman,
who subsequently returned to her own tribe, had then a second
child by a native man. Mr. Thomson states, that other instances
of the kind had occurred in the colony; and he strikes
a fatal blow at Mr. Harvey’s theory by adding, that the Australian
women who have for a certain time cohabited with the
Whites, are not more prolific with them than with the natives.
But though Mr. Thomson has endeavoured to prove that the
cohabitation with Europeans does not necessarily render Australian
women barren with men of their own race, he acknowledges
that such a result is very common. He admits it as a fact
which cannot be contested,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> and considers it so certain that he
tries to explain it, by attributing it to the following causes:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The European who has cohabited with an Australian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>woman, sends her away after the lapse of a few years, when
she is often not young enough to produce children, as Australian
women rarely conceive after the thirtieth year. 2. The
cohabitation with a European modifies the constitution of the
savage woman, who smokes, and is frequently intoxicated
during that time. 3. Having not lost the habits of savage
life, she returns to her tribe, where she now has some difficulty
to support fatigues and irregularities, which diminishes her
fecundity. 4. Finally, when she becomes a mother, and the
fatigues of maternity are added to her other troubles, she tries
to escape them by infanticide. It is to the united effect of
these causes that the author attributes the rarity of children
born of Australian native women who have returned to their
tribes.</p>

<p>It is very significant when an author, despite of himself,
confirms by his theories, facts which he had undertaken to
disprove. I will not allude again to the story of infanticide,
a hundred times more improbable here, than in cases where
the child had been begotten by a European. Though it follows,
from Mr. Thomson’s article, that Strzelecki’s assertion
was too general, it results at the same time that the assertion
was well founded. But this is not the place to search for the
explanation of a phenomenon which, despite the efforts of Mr.
Harvey, does not touch hybridity. If I have dwelt on the
fact, it is because the polemics raised by Strzelecki’s observations
have incontestably established that the <i>cohabitation</i> of
Whites and native Australian women is very common in
Australia; and we do not comprehend under this name the
sexual intercourse which is accidental and transitory, such as
occurs when the women come to market, but the cohabitation
under the same roof, and prolonged during several months,
and even years. The scarcity of Australian Mulattoes can
thus be attributed neither to the rarity nor to the transitory
nature of sexual intercourse; neither can we admit, until we
are better informed, that the relative sterility of such crossings
is the consequence of some homœogenesic defect between the
two races.</p>

<p>In studying the cases preceding those just mentioned, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
have put the question whether Mulattoes of the first degree
were, between themselves, indefinitely prolific, to answer which
we had to analyse a certain number of facts. In the present
case the facts fail us, and the question can only be examined
theoretically. No traveller or author has spoken of the alliance
of Australian Mulattoes between themselves, nor of their
recrossing on the parent stock. No writer has informed us
whether these Mulattoes are robustious, intelligent, vivacious,
or, on the contrary, weak, stupid, and short-lived. One thing
appears to me certain, that the number of young Mulattoes
who die at an early age, or who are not viable, must be relatively
considerable, and this may perhaps have given rise to
the accusation of infanticide, which I have already refuted.
This defective progeny is also observed in the crossings of
certain species of animals but little homœogenesic; and if it
be true, as everything tends to establish, that the union of the
Whites and the Australian women is but little prolific, we may
suppose that Mulattoes sprung from such disparate unions,
must enter the category of inferior cross-breeds. Are they
very prolific between themselves? This seems not very probable,
though we have no experimental knowledge of it. It is
even doubtful whether they are very prolific with the Whites,
for no one has mentioned the existence of Quadroon Mulattoes,
which might be as easily recognised as the Quadroons of
the Antilles. However small the number of hybrid women of
the first degree may be, these women ought to have produced
with the Whites, if they had been very prolific, a progeny
which ought to have become numerous in the population of a
colony founded above seventy years; for there can be no
doubt that there, as everywhere, the woman of colour selects
by preference the alliance of men of a superior race.</p>

<p>I am far from advancing these suppositions as demonstrated
truths. I have studied and analysed all documents within my
reach; but I cannot be responsible for facts not ascertained
by myself, and which are too much in opposition to generally
received opinions to be admitted without strict investigation.
I, therefore, earnestly draw the attention of travellers, and especially
of physicians resident in Australia to this subject, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
importance of which I have endeavoured to point out. Until
we obtain further particulars we can only reason upon the
known facts; but these, it must be admitted, are so numerous
and so authentic as to constitute if not a rigorous definitive demonstration,
at least a strong presumption in favour of the
doctrines of polygenists.</p>

<h3>Conclusions on human hybridity</h3>

<p>From the whole of our researches on the hybridity of the
human race we obtain the following results:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That certain intermixtures are perfectly eugenesic.</p>

<p>2. That other intermixtures are in their results notably inferior
to those of eugenesic hybridity.</p>

<p>3. That Mulattoes of the first degree, issued from the union
of the Germanic (Anglo-Saxon) race with the African Negroes,
appear inferior in fecundity and longevity to individuals of the
pure races.</p>

<p>4. That it is at least doubtful, whether these Mulattoes, in
their alliances between themselves, are capable of indefinitely
perpetuating their race, and that they are less prolific in their
direct alliances than in their recrossing with the parent stocks,
as is observed in paragenesic hybridity.</p>

<p>5. That alliances between the Germanic race (Anglo-Saxon)
with the Melanesian races (Australians and Tasmanians) are but
little prolific.</p>

<p>6. That the Mulattoes sprung from such intercourse are
too rare to have enabled us to obtain exact particulars as to
their viability and fecundity.</p>

<p>7. That several degrees of hybridity, which have been observed
in the cross-breeds of animals of different species, seem
also to occur in the various crossings of men of different races.</p>

<p>8. That the lowest degree of human hybridity in which the
homœogenesis is so feeble as to render the fecundity of the
first crossing uncertain, is exhibited in the most disparate
crossings between one of the most elevated and the two lowest
races of humanity.</p>

<h2>SECTION IV.</h2>

<h3 style="visibility: visible; page-break-before: never;">RECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION.<br /><br /></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> numerous and controverted questions which we had to
discuss, have more than once interrupted the chain of our
thesis. It may, therefore, be useful to present here a <i>résumé</i> of
the various parts of our argumentation.</p>

<p>Zoologists have, in <i>each</i> of the natural groups which constitute
the genera, recognised <i>several</i> types which they denominate
species.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>The human group evidently constitutes one genus; if it consisted
only of one species, it would form a single exception in
creation. It is, therefore, but natural to presume, that this
genus is, like all the others, composed of different species.</p>

<p>In the greater number of genera, the various species differ
much less from each other than certain human races. A naturalist,
who, without touching the question of origin, purely
and simply applies to the human genus the general principles
of zootaxis, would be inclined to divide this genus into different
species.</p>

<p>This mode of viewing the subject can only be abandoned, if
it were by observation demonstrated that all the difference between
human races had been the result of modifications caused
in the organisation of man by the influence of media.</p>

<p>The monogenists have at first made great efforts to furnish
such a demonstration, but without success. Observation has,
on the contrary, shown, that though the organisation of man
may, in the course of time, and under the influence of external
conditions, undergo some modification, yet that these modifications
are relatively very slight, and have no relation to the
typical differences of human races. Man, transplanted into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>new climate, and subjected to a new mode of life, conserves
and transmits to posterity all the essential characters of his
race, and his descendants do not acquire the character of the
indigenous race or races. <i>Cœlum, non corpus mutant qui trans
mare currunt.</i></p>

<p>The monogenists have objected that the period of distant
colonies is too recent; that the observations tending to establish
the permanence of human types date scarcely from three
or four centuries, and that this lapse of time is insufficient to
produce a transformation of races, and that such a transformation
has been produced gradually during the long series of
centuries elapsed, according to some from the creation of man,
and according to others since the Deluge.</p>

<p>But the study of the Egyptian paintings has shown, that on
the one hand the principal types of the human genus existed
then, 2,500 years at least before Jesus Christ, as they exist at
this day.</p>

<p>Again, the Jewish race, scattered for more than eighteen
centuries in the most different climates, is everywhere the
same now as it was in Egypt at the time of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>The period of <i>positive</i> observations dates thus, from more
than forty centuries and not from three or four.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>Having no longer any hope to prove by direct demonstrations
that the distinctive characters of human races are transformations
of one primitive type, the monogenists sought for
indirect proofs. They believed to have found them in this
fact, or rather assertion, that there is always a certain relation
between the characters of human races and the media in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>they exist. On close examination this assertion is found to be
without any foundation. On studying one by one the principal
ethnological characters and their distribution on the surface
of the globe, it has been shown that there is no relation
between these different characters and the climatic and hygienic
conditions.</p>

<p>The monogenists then resorted to an argumentation still
more indirect. They advanced that in the whole <i>genus homo</i>
there existed a fund of common ideas, creeds, knowledge, and
language, attesting the common origin of all human beings.
It might be objected that this argument is without any value
whatever; considering that indirect communications between
peoples of different origin might have passed to each other
words, usages, and ideas. But a profound study of the question
has shown that there are certain peoples who have absolutely
no notion of God or soul, whose languages have no relation
whatever to any, who are altogether anti-social, and who
differ from the Caucasians more by the intellectual and moral
capacities than by their physical characters.</p>

<p>There was even no necessity to insist upon the difficulty, or
rather geographical impossibility of the dispersion of so many
races proceeding from a common origin, nor to remark that
before the remote and the almost recent migrations of Europeans,
each natural group of human races occupied upon our
planet a region characterised by a special fauna; that no
American animal was found either in Australia nor in the ancient
continent, and where men of a new type were discovered,
there were only found animals belonging to species, even to
genera, and sometimes to zoological orders, without analogues
in other regions of the globe.</p>

<p>And whilst it was thus simple to suppose that there were
several <i>faci</i> of the creation of man, as well as of other beings;
and whilst this doctrine, so conformable to all the data furnished
by natural science, removed all geographical objections,
explaining thus all the analogies and differences of human
types, and the repartition of each group; whilst, in one word,
it exactly accounted for all the known facts, the opposite doctrine
moved in a circle of contradictory suppositions super<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>imposed
by hypotheses; theories founded upon a small number
of facts upset by other unexpected facts; imaginary influences
refuted by observation; anti-historical legends dispelled by
historical monuments; lame explanations destroyed by physiology;
obscure sophisms refuted by logic; and all this to demonstrate,
not exactly that all races descend from the same
pair, but that, strictly speaking, such is not altogether impossible.</p>

<p>Whence have the monogenists derived the requisite perseverance
and courage to impose upon their reason such continuous
restraint, and to resist the testimonies of observation,
science, and history?</p>

<p>On analysing their system, we find at every moment two
fundamental axioms which serve them as articles of faith, and
the evidence of which appears to them sufficient to surmount
all other objections.</p>

<p>These two axioms have served as the premises of an apparently
irresistible syllogism.</p>

<p>1. All animals, capable of producing an eugenesic progeny,
are of the same species.</p>

<p>2. All human crossings are eugenesic.</p>

<p>Therefore, all men are of the same species.</p>

<p>The monogenists, convinced of the reality of the premises of
this syllogism, thought their doctrine to stand on a solid foundation,
and defended it with that confidence inspired by conviction.</p>

<p>Assailed by pressing objections, constantly obliged to yield,
incapable of advancing a step without an immediate retreat,
they felt their forces revive by resorting to their syllogism,
like Antæus when he touched the earth. As long as the refuge
remained they continued the struggle, though not with advantage,
at least with the ardour of faith; for though faith
no longer moves mountains, it still leaves the hope of moving
them.</p>

<p>But these two fundamental propositions, admitted as axioms,
do they express the truth? Can this triumphant syllogism, of
which they are the premises, stand? Is it true that only animals
of the same species can produce a prolific progeny? Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
it true that all human crossings are eugenesic? To upset the
syllogism of the monogenists, and to deprive their system of any
scientific base, it might be sufficient that the first of the above
questions should be answered in the negative. The system
would then become what it was before it came in contact with
science, namely, a belief more or less respectable, founded
upon a sentiment or a dogma. But if the second question were
also negatived, and it could be demonstrated that all human
crossings are not eugenesic, then not merely the syllogism,
but the whole doctrine of the monogenists would crumble to
pieces. The doctrine would then not merely be extra-scientific,
but anti-scientific; it being positive that two groups of animals,
so different as to be incapable of fusion by generation,
do not belong to the same species. This is an incontestable
and uncontested truth.</p>

<p>We were thus led to examine successively the two fundamental
propositions serving as a base to the unitarian doctrine,
for which purpose a series of researches were requisite.</p>

<p>We have, in the first place, investigated the results of certain
crossings between animals of incontestably different species,
such as dogs and wolves, goats and sheep, camels and
dromedaries, hares and rabbits, etc.; and we have demonstrated
<i>that these crossings produce eugenesic mongrels, that is to say,
perfectly and indefinitely prolific between themselves</i>.</p>

<p>It is thus not true that all animals capable of producing an
eugenesic progeny are of the same species; and even if all
human intermixtures were eugenesic, as is generally believed,
we could not infer from this the unity of the human species.
The monogenists are thus deprived of their principal basis and
their sole scientific argument.</p>

<p>It was, however, necessary to inquire, whether this popular
axiom, that all human crossings are eugenesic, was a demonstrated
truth or a lightly accepted hypothesis, without any
verification or control? Such has been the object of our
second series of investigations.</p>

<p>We recognised at the outset that the monogenists, considering
their axiom as self-evident, have made no efforts to establish
its correctness, so that, strictly speaking, we might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
discarded it. When, contrary to the opinion of several modern
authors, we wished to establish that there were really eugenesic
intermixtures in the human genus, we found in science assertions
without proofs, and we believe that our investigations
concerning the mixed populations of France have, in this respect,
the merit of novelty. We may be mistaken as to the
value of our demonstration; but we venture to assert, that this
demonstration is the first that has been attempted.</p>

<p>After having rendered, if not quite certain, at least extremely
probable, that <i>certain</i> human crossings are eugenesic, we
have inquired whether <i>all</i> human crossings are in the same
condition.</p>

<p>From the documents collected it results, that <i>certain</i> human
crossings yield results notably inferior to such as constitute
in animals eugenesic hybridity. The whole of the known facts
permit us to consider as very probable, that certain human
races taken two by two are less homœogenesic; as, for instance,
the species of the dog and the wolf. If we are to make any
reservation, and leave some doubts upon this conclusion, it is
that we cannot admit, without numerous verifications, a fact
which definitively demonstrates the plurality of human species;
a fact, by the presence of which, all other discussion is rendered
superfluous; a fact, finally, of which the political and
social consequences would be immense.</p>

<p>We cannot too much insist upon drawing the attention of
observers upon this subject. But whatever be the result of
ulterior researches on human hybridity, it remains well attested
that animals of different species may produce an eugenesic progeny,
and that consequently we cannot, from the fecundity of
human intermixture, however disparate the races may be,
draw a physiological argument in favour of the unity of species,
even if the fecundity were as certain as it is doubtful.</p>

<p>The great problem we have investigated in this essay is one
of those which have caused great agitation, and most difficult to
approach with a mind unbiassed by any extra-scientific preconception.
This was almost inevitable; but science must keep
aloof from anything not within its province. There is no faith,
however respectable, no interest, however legitimate, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
must not accommodate itself to the progress of human knowledge
and bend before truth, if that truth be demonstrated. Hence
it is always hazardous to mix up theological arguments with
discussions of this kind, and to stigmatise in the name of religion
any scientific opinion, since, if that opinion, sooner or
later gains ground, religion has been uselessly compromised.
The unskilful intervention of theologians in astronomical questions
(rotation of the earth), in physiology (pre-existence of
germs), in medicine (possessions), etc., has formed more infidels
than the writings of philosophers. Why should men be placed
in the dilemma of choosing between science and faith? And
when so many striking examples have placed theologians under
the necessity to acknowledge that revelation is not applicable
to science, why do they obstinately continue to place the Bible
before the wheels of progress?<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>Sincere Christians have understood that the moment is come
to prepare the conciliation of the doctrine of the polygenists
with the sacred writings. They are disposed to admit that the
Mosaic narration does not apply to the whole human race, but
merely to the <i>Adamites</i>, from which sprung God’s people; that
there may have been other human beings with whom the sacred
writer had no concern; that it is nowhere said that the sons of
Adam contracted incestuous alliances with their own sisters;
that Cain, banished after the murder of his brother, had a mark
set upon him that no one might kill him; that, besides the
sons of God, there was a race of the sons of man; that the
origin of the sons of men is not specified; that nothing
authorises us to consider these as the progeny of Adam; that
these two races differed in their physical characters, since, by
their union, a cross-breed was produced designated by the
name of giants, “to indicate the physical and moral energy of
mixed races.” And that, finally, all these antediluvian races
might have survived the deluge in the persons of the three
daughters-in-law of Noah.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>We have collated here the observations of various authors,
one of whom, the Rev. John Bachmann, remarks with evident
satisfaction that, if contrary to the prevailing opinion, the
multiplicity of human species should eventually be demonstrated,
which he considers very improbable, the authority of
the Bible would still remain unshaken, and that “the highest
interest of mankind would not suffer by it.” We have here a
preparatory conciliation as a sort of prevision of ulterior scientific
developments. Very recently a fervent Catholic, a physician,
who in his various voyages has attentively studied the
races of mankind, Mr. Sagot, has advanced an hypothesis
which we consider as quite new, and which would enable us,
better than by the preceding suppositions, to accommodate
the biblical narration with anthropological science. After
having demonstrated that the physical, intellectual, and moral
characters establish between the races of men profound differences,
which are indelible, and that all influences to which
they have been attributed are absurd and imaginary, inasmuch
as natural causes would never have produced such a deviation
from the primitive form, Mr. Sagot supposes that the division
in perfectly distinct races, and their methodical dispersion and
repartition upon the surface of the earth, was a miraculous intervention
of Providence. He is of opinion that this great
fact was accomplished at the period of the confusion of tongues,
that is, after the audacious enterprise of the Tower of Babel,
and that God, in dispersing the families, endowed each with
a peculiar organisation and aptitudes accommodated to the
various climates assigned to them.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Whether the differences
of human races and their geographical distribution was the
consequence of distinct creations, or miraculous transformations
equivalent to new creations, comes to the same thing as
regards the doctrine of polygenists. Their object is not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>enter into any theological discussions; they have been driven
to it, and they will no doubt be delighted to hear that their
doctrine may become developed without offending anybody.</p>

<p>The intervention of political and social considerations has
not been less injurious to Anthropology than the religious element.
When generous philanthropists claimed, with indefatigable
constancy, the liberty of the blacks, the partisans of
the old system, threatened in their dearest interests, were
enchanted to hear that Negros were scarcely human beings,
but rather domestic animals, more intelligent and productive
than the rest. At that time the scientific question became a
question of sentiment, and whoever wished for the abolition of
slavery, thought himself bound to admit that Negroes were
Caucasians blackened and frizzled by the sun. Now that
France and England, the two most civilised nations, have definitively
emancipated their slaves, science may claim its rights
without caring for the sophisms of slaveholders.</p>

<p>Many honest men think that the moment to speak freely is
not yet come, as the emancipation struggle is far from being
at an end in the United States of America, and that we should
avoid furnishing the slaveholders with arguments. But is it
true that the polygenist doctrine, which is scarcely a century
old,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> is any degree responsible for an order of things which
has existed from time immemorial, and which has developed
and perpetuated itself during a long series of centuries, under
the shade of the doctrine of monogenists, which remained so
long uncontested? And can we believe that the slave-owners
are much embarrassed to find arguments in the Bible? The
Rev. John Bachmann, a fervent monogenist of South Carolina,
has acquired in the Southern States much popularity by demonstrating,
with great unction, that slavery is a divine institution.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
It is not from the writings of polygenists, but from the Bible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>that the representatives of the Slave States have drawn their arguments;
and Mr. Bachmann tells us that the Abolitionists of
Congress have been struck dumb by such an irrefragable authority!
It must, therefore, not be believed that there is any connexion
between the scientific and the political question. The
difference of origin by no means implicates the subordination of
races. It, on the contrary, implicates the idea that each race of
men has originated in a determined region, as it were, as the
crown of the fauna of that region; and if it were permitted
to guess at the intention of nature, we might be led to suppose
that she has assigned a distinct inheritance to each race, because,
despite of all that has been said of the cosmopolitism of
man, the inviolability of the domain of certain races is determined
by their climate.</p>

<p>Let this mode of viewing the question be compared with
that of the monogenists, and let it be asked which of the two
modes is more apt to please the defenders of slavery. If all
men are descendants of one couple,&mdash;if the inequality of races
has been the result of a curse more or less merited,&mdash;or again,
if the one have degraded themselves, and have allowed the
torch of their primitive intelligence to become extinct, whilst
the other have carefully guarded the precious gift of the
Creator,&mdash;in other words, if there be cursed and blessed races,&mdash;races
which have obeyed the voice of nature and races
which have disobeyed it,&mdash;then the Rev. John Bachmann is
right to say that slavery is a Divine right; that it is a providential
punishment; and that it is just, to a certain point, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>those races who have degraded themselves should be placed
under the <i>protection</i> of others,&mdash;to borrow an ingenious euphemism
from the language of the defenders of slavery.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> But
if the Ethiopian is king of Soudan by the same right as the
Caucasian is king of Europe, what right has he to impose laws
upon the former, unless by the right of might? In the first
case, slavery presents itself with a certain appearance of legitimacy
which might render it excusable in the eyes of certain
theoricians; in the second case, it is a fact of pure violence,
protested against by all who derive no benefit from it.</p>

<p>From another point of view, it might be said that the polygenist
doctrine assigns to the inferior races of humanity a more
honourable place than in the opposite doctrine. To be inferior
to another man either in intelligence, vigour, or beauty, is not
a humiliating condition. On the contrary, one might be
ashamed to have undergone a physical or moral degradation,
to have descended the scale of beings, and to have lost rank in
creation.</p>

Campbell (1813), John Philips (1825), Thompson (1824), etc., in the Collection
of Voyages by Walkenaer, t. xv-xxi, Paris, 1842. In 1801 Truter and Somerville
found near the Orange or Gariep river, in the district where now Griqua
town stands, a horde of <i>Bastaards</i> and <i>Bosjesmen</i>, commanded by a Bastaard
of the name of Kok (t. xvii, p. 364). On their return they found a considerable
village, composed of Kaffirs, Hottentots, and mongrel breeds of several
varieties, under the command of a chief named Kok (p. 393). In the same
year Kitchener, the missionary, assembled the horde in a village. There
came pure Hottentots and Namaquas (t. xviii, p. 126). In 1802 Anderson,
the missionary, in organising the growing nation, gave authority to the Bastaards
(p. 127). The village of Laawater or Klaarwater, which has since
become Griqua-town, consisted in 1805, when Lichtenstein visited it, of
about thirty families, one-half of which belonged to the Bastaard race, the
rest were Namaquas or Hottentots. The village enlarged rapidly “by the
arrival of refugees, and by marriages with the women of the Bosjesmen and
the Koramas, who lived in the vicinity” (t. xix, p. 355). They practised
polygamy. “They constituted a horde of nomadic naked savages, living by
pillage and the chase; their bodies were besmeared with red paint, the hair
covered with grease, living in ignorance, without any trace of civilisation”
(p. 356). After the lapse of five years the missionaries commenced civilising
them by giving them the taste for agricultural pursuits. The name, however,
of <i>Bastaards</i>, which indicated their European origin, was no longer
suitable to this nation, in which the African blood was greatly predominating.
They took, therefore, the name of <i>Griquas</i>. Campbell asserts that they chose
that name, as it was that of the principal family (t. xviii, p. 395). This explanation
appears to me very doubtful. Ten Rhyne, who explored Southern Africa in 1673, twenty year after the first disembarkation of Europeans,
already mentions the existence of a Hottentot people who went by the name
of <i>Gregoriquos</i> (t. xv, p. 122). Thirty years after (1705) Kolbe designates the
same people <i>Gauriquas</i> (t. xv, p. 253). There existed at that time another
people, called <i>Chirigriquas</i>. In 1775 Thunberg still speaks of Gauriquas
(t. xvi, p. 201), and of Chirigriquas. All these names have evidently the
same root, and the singularity of Hottentot enunciation induced probably
the various travellers to adopt a different orthography. It is thus presumable
that the Hottentots of Klaarwater, in calling themselves Griquas, merely
adopted the old name Gauriquas. There exists to this day the people <i>Koraquas</i>,
signifying “people who wear shoes” (Burchell, t. xx, p. 60). They live
in the neighbourhood of Klaarwater. Be this as it may, the new people of
the Griquas gave to Klaarwater, influenced by the English missionaries, the
name of Griqua-town. This town, called by Malte-Brun Kriqua, grew
rapidly by the adjunction of the Koranas. In 1813 there were not less than
1,341 Koranas in a population of 2,607 inhabitants (t. xviii, p. 393). In 1814
the governor of the Cape tried to force the Griquas to furnish men for the
indigenous army. The proposal was very badly received, and the nation was
nearly in a state of dissolution. A portion of the inhabitants of Griqua-town
escaped to the surrounding mountains, and formed bands of robbers, who,
under the name of Bergmaars, devastated the country, and, associating with
bands of Koranas, pillaged and massacred the Betchouanas and the Bosjesmen,
and <i>carried off their women and children</i>. In 1825, owing to the intervention
of John Philips, the Bergmaars were reduced to order, and returned
to Griqua-town. They had now crossed with the Koranas, the Betchouanas,
and Bosjesmen (t. xviii, p. 357). Some time previously a grave dissension had
broken out among the settled Griquas. The governor of the Cape had sent an
agent, John Melvil, with an important charge to a certain Waterboer, a Bosjesman
by origin. The supremacy had hitherto belonged to the family Kok,
who, proud of the drops of European blood in their veins, would not recognise
the authority of Waterboer, and emigrated accordingly. Waterboer was,
however, not dismissed; and in 1825 John Philips found the Griquas divided
in three kraals, under the chiefs Kok, Berend, and Waterboer (t. xix, p. 370).
If Dr. Prichard had taken the trouble to consult these documents he would
have recognised that the Griquas had, by so many consecutive crossings, become
almost a pure African race. Modern geographers range therefore the
Griquas among the Hottentots, calling them Hottentot-Griquas. It is also
noteworthy that Prichard, in citing the Griquas as an example of a mixed
race, has given no description of them. In order that the example should be
of any value, it is requisite that the Griquas should present an intermediate
type between the Europeans and the natives. Neither Dr. Prichard nor any
travellers say so. There is another consideration. The origin of the Griqua
nation dates from the beginning of the nineteenth century. Dr. Prichard
last speaks of them in 1843. Two generations had not yet elapsed. There
is another point. In 1800 the tribe of Kok was a horde but little numerous;
in 1824 it was a people of five thousand souls, including seven hundred armed
warriors (Thompson, <i>loc. cit.</i>, t. xxi, p. 22). It is clear that this people were
not descended from the primitive tribe, but had increased by numerous adjunctions.
Father Peteam himself, if he were still alive, would be obliged to
admit this. I have been very minute as to the Griquas, but I flatter myself
that this is sufficient to discard from science the assertion of Prichard, which
all modern monogenists have received with so much favour.</p></div>

signification. Such is not the case with the denominations adopted by certain
authors derived from the colour of the skin. Thus the Caucasians were
termed the <i>white</i>, the Mongolians the <i>yellow</i>, the Ethiopian the <i>black</i>, the
Malayo-Polynesian the <i>brown</i>, and finally, the American the <i>red</i> race. It
has been shown that the American type alone includes red, brown, black,
white and yellow races. There are brown races in the American, and even in
the Caucasian type. All the black races do not belong to the Ethiopian type;
and finally, the Malayo-Polynesian type comprises races of colours as various
as those belonging to the American type. A classification founded on differences
of colour would lead to numerous and serious errors.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> It is undoubted that several American races have been destroyed within
300 years; others having been reduced to a few families, will soon disappear.
The Charruas were exterminated in 1831 by the Spaniards of South America:
root and branch, as Dr. Latham says. In 1835, four years later, the English
of Van Diemen’s Land, after a horrible massacre, transported 210 Tasmanians,
men, women, and children, to a small island (Flinders), in Bass’ Straits. In 1842,
after seven years of exile, the number of these unfortunates amounted to 54!
This was all that remained of a race which, 40 years previously, occupied the
whole of Van Diemen’s Land, as large as Ireland, and we may soon learn that
none of them are in existence. The Malays have entirely destroyed the
black races who preceded them in certain isles of the great Indian Archipelago.
The Guanches now only exit in a mummified state. The black and prognathous
race which occupied the isles of Japan before the arrival of the Mongolians,
have left no other traces behind than their crania imbedded in the
soil; and it is easy to foresee that within one or two centuries all the black
races will have disappeared from these parts, and have been succeeded by
Malayans and Europeans.</p></div>

has increased by 56,786. In 1840, there were 327,934 slaves; in 1850,
384,720. This is an increase of more than 17 per cent. The slaves of all
shades are comprised in this account, but the pure Negroes form the great
majority, and it is probable that to them exclusively is owing the large increase
in the number of slaves. The number of cross-breeds cannot be ascertained
by the statistics given. It would, besides, be impossible to distinguish
in the reports given the Mestizos born from the union of Mulattoes
and Mulatresses, and those from whites and blacks. Statistics thus throw
no light upon the question, whether the Mulatto race maintains itself. But
there is a peculiar class of men of colour which is the object of attention of
certain governments, who maintain with satisfaction that this class notably
diminishes. It is the class of free men of colour, enjoying certain civic rights
very inconvenient for the slave states. There was a time when the enfranchisement
of coloured men had no obstacles to contend with, and the number
of free men of colour increased rapidly. Many white owners gave freedom
to their natural children. But when restrictive laws were introduced, the
number of free coloured men began diminishing. They no longer ally themselves
with the Whites, who despise them, nor with the slaves, and are thus
reduced to intermarry between themselves. The census of Charleston gave,
in 1830, the number of free coloured men and their descendants as amounting
to 2,107; in 1848 it was reduced to 1,492, a diminution of 605 in 2,107, more
than 29 per cent. The <i>Charleston Mercury</i> published these figures to show
that the class of freed slaves need not excite any apprehension in South Carolina,
and that the Governor carried his zeal too far in proposing to expel
that class. Such an enormous decrease depends, no doubt to a great extent,
on the small number of births. There is another circumstance which might
have contributed to reduce the caste; which is, that any freed individual, or
his descendant, once leaving the state, is not permitted to return; this, however,
forms but a minor cause of the decay. (See <i>Charleston Medical Journal</i>,
May 1851, vol. vi, p. 381).</p></div>

but the island was, 1655, conquered by the English, when all <i>the old colonists</i>
retired, carrying away the greater portion of their wealth. Cromwell hastened
to re-people the island, by transporting to it a number of political convicts.
In 1659, four years after the conquest, there were already 4,500 Europeans
and 1,400 Negroes on the island. In 1670, the white population amounted
to 7,500, slaves 8,000. It will then, be observed, that the population of
Jamaica descends exclusively from <i>English</i> colonists and Negro slaves. With
regard to the Caribs, they have been entirely exterminated by the Spaniards
a century before the arrival of the English.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> The relation of Lewis is, in certain respects, more suggestive than that of
Long. The latter says that the Mulattoes of the first degree are well constituted;
while Lewis pretends that they are mostly <i>weak and flabby</i>, whence
it results that the physical inferiority becomes manifest at <i>the very first
crossing</i>. We believe this to be incorrect. The author endeavours to explain
the defect of vitality in the children of Mulattoes, and has recourse to a
theory which, if well founded, would, instead of weakening, only strengthen
the fact. On the other hand, we believe that the assertion of Long, despite
of the corrective which accompanies it, is too general. If it were true that
the union of Mulattoes is always unproductive in Jamaica, the fact would
have been too evident not to have been long known, for <i>absolute</i> sterility is
easily ascertained. Relative sterility, however, may long escape notice, considering
that there is always in the pure races a certain number of cases of
sporadic sterility. It is probable that further investigations will establish for
Jamaica conclusions analogous to those adopted by Mr. Nott for South Carolina;
namely, that the Mulattoes of this <i>English</i> island are less prolific between
themselves than with the whites or blacks, and that their direct descendants
are generally less vivacious and prolific than the men of the pure races.</p></div>

find in the voyage of Havorinus a passage which may, perhaps, explain the
singular act pointed out by Graf Görtz. Having given the number of the
European population of Batavia, Havorinus adds, “Among the Europeans
figure also such as are born from European parents, among whom females
form the great majority” (Havorinus, <i>Voyage par le Cap de Bonne-Espérance

seems thus that the influence of climate produces some modification in the
generative powers of Europeans, rendering them less apt to procreate males
even with the women of their own race. This modification may be transmitted
to their descendants by intermixtures. The fact of Havorinus should,
however, be verified.</p></div>

passes differently. The Mulattoes are slaves like the Negroes. A large
number of Mulatresses become the concubines of the White: and the Mulattoes
are mostly obliged to confine themselves to Negro women. There
are, then, relatively few unions between Mulattoes of the same blood. The
abolition of slavery neither could, nor will for a long time, sensibly modify
this state of things. The prejudice against colour will not soon become
effaced; and many Mulatto women prefer to be the mistresses of Whites to
being the wives of Mulattoes. In the East Indies, the prejudice of colour
does not exist. The Whites are merely considered as an aristocratic class;
the Malays are free as well as the Mulattoes, they have always been so. The
Mulattoes are proud of having in their veins European blood, as, in our own
country, certain citizens are proud of their aristocratic alliances. They form
thus, <i>in the centres of the population</i>, a sort of intermediate caste between
the Whites and the natives.</p></div>

of the Mulattoes of Cambojia, the offspring of the native race and the
immigrant Chinese. Cambojia is situated south-west of Siam, south of Anam,
between 10° and 14°. “It is remarkable,” he observes, “that the marriages
of native females with the Chinese are productive at the first generation,
but become gradually sterile, and completely so at the fifth generation. I
have seen many such cases; but, I cannot explain such a degeneration between
nations so similar in physical conformation, and their mode of life.
If it were not so, the Chinese race ought to become predominant, and absorb
the native race in a few centuries. Such has not been the case, and the innumerable
immigrants which China pours in appear scarce among the population.”

of Mexico and South America; the observations relative to these crossings
are extremely difficult to collect, for the variation of Mulattoes of different
degrees is not so apparent as in the Mulattoes, Quadroons, etc., of
Negroes and Europeans. With regard to colour, hair, shape of the cranium,
the European races, especially those of the south, differ infinitely less from
the American races than from the Ethiopian and the intermediate characters;
even Mulattoes of the first degree are much less marked in the first than in
the second case. Thus the famous Paulistas of the province of Saint-Paul,
Brazil, issued from the union of Portuguese and Indians, constitute a vigorous
class, brave, and even heroic, though ferocious and turbulent. According
to certain authors, the European blood predominates in them; others,
on the contrary, maintain that they are pure Indians. These contradictions
prove the difficulty of estimating the degree of the intermixture between
the Mulattoes sprung from Europeans and Indians. The question whether
<i>Mulattoes of the first degree</i> are indefinitely prolific <i>between themselves</i>,&mdash;whether
they are habitually, or only exceptionally so, cannot be solved by
travellers. Resident observers, and especially physicians, may ultimately
furnish precise facts.</p></div>

of the natives. A regular <i>battue</i> was organised in the whole island,
and in a short time all Tasmanians, without distinction of age or sex, were
exterminated, with the exception of two hundred and ten individuals, who
were transported to the little isle, Flinders (or, Fourneaux), in Bass’s Straits.
This was all the remnant of a race which, before the arrival of the English,
had occupied a territory nearly as large as Ireland. This dreadful massacre
produced a profound horror in the English Parliament, but it was not thought
of to send these unfortunates back again to their native soil. Measures
were, however, taken to treat them humanely in the isle of Flinders, and to
provide them abundantly with victuals; they were also instructed in religion.
The island is about thirteen leagues in length by seven in breadth; the refugees
had thus no want of space. Nevertheless, of these two hundred and
ten individuals, most of them adults, perished rapidly, and Count Strzelecki,
who visited them in 1842, found only fifty-four. Within seven years and a few
months, only fourteen children wore born. (Strzelecki, <i>Physical Description of

arrived at the age of puberty, an irresistible instinct compels them to return
to their solitudes.” We know of no other particulars regarding the attempts
made by the English to civilise the natives. This fact, similar to those of
Australia, comes from a source which cannot be suspected, since the writer
of the letter, as well as M. Rienzi, are well disposed towards the natives.</p></div>

(Rienzi, <i>l’Océanie</i>, p. 543). Supposing that this number only amounted to
7,000 in 1830&mdash;say 3,500 boys and 3,500 girls&mdash;there would remain for the

race of men, who have been held to be the descendants of the Vandals. It is
certain that no white race has been established in these parts since the time
of Genserich, that is to say, some fourteen centuries. If so, there would result
from it that a sojourn of fourteen centuries upon the African soil was
not sufficient to darken the hair of the white race. But Dumoulin, taking
the text of Procopius for his guide, had already demonstrated that the light-haired
race of northern Africa had nothing in common with the Vandals;
and I have recently found a passage in the <i>Périple de la Méditerranée de
Syclax</i>, a work anterior to Alexander the Great, in which mention is made of
a tribe of <i>light-haired</i> Lybians, who occupied the littoral of the Minor Syrtis,
not far from Mount Auress, where to this day one of the principal tribes of
light-haired Kabyles resides. (See <i>Bulletins de la Soc. d’Anthropologie, séance

<p><a name="Footnote_87_87" id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> We may be permitted to reproduce here some passage from a dissertation
of this pious slave owner; we extract them from the <i>Charleston Medical
Journal and Review</i>, Sept. 1854, vol. ix. pp. 657-659: “All races of men including
the Negroes, are of the same species and origin. The Negro is a
striking variety, and at present permanent, as the numerous varieties of
domestic animals. The Negro will remain what he is, unless his form is
altered by intermixture, the simple idea of which is revolting; his intelligence
is greatly inferior to that of the Caucasians, and he is consequently,
from all we know of him, incapable of governing himself. He has been
placed under our protection (a very pretty word). The vindication of slavery
is contained in the scriptures. The Bible teaches the rights and duties of
masters, in order that the slaves should be treated with justice and goodness,
and it enjoins obedience to slaves.... The Bible furnishes us with the best
weapons of which we can avail ourselves. It shows us that the ancient
Israelites possessed slaves. It determines the duties of masters and slaves;
and Saint Paul writes an epistle to Philemon to request him to take back
a runaway slave. Our representatives in Congress have drawn their arguments
from Holy Writ, and their adversaries have not ventured to tell them
that the historical part of the Bible (and all that concerns slavery is historical)
is false and uninspired;” and, adds the Rev. John Bachmann, “we
can effectually defend our institutions from the word of God.”</p></div>

Minutes of the proceedings during their progress; and,
at the commencement of every Meeting, read the Minutes
of the previous Meeting. At the Ordinary Meetings
they shall announce the presents received since the last
Meeting. They shall make a note of the Papers read at the
Ordinary Meetings, to be inserted in the Minutes; and see

properly placed and catalogued.</p>

<p>43. Conjointly with the Treasurer, they shall have charge
of the accounts of the Society. And no account shall be
brought before the Council, until they or one of them,
attest in writing that they have examined it, and believe
it to be accurate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Property of
the Society.</div>

<p>44. The whole of the property and effects of the
Society, of what kind soever, shall be vested in three
Trustees, for its use: one of whom shall always be the
Treasurer for the time being; and the other two shall be
chosen at a General Meeting of the Society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Original
Papers.</div>

<p>45. Every Paper which may be presented to the
Society shall, in consequence of such presentation, be
considered as the property of the Society, unless there
shall have been any previous engagement with its author
to the contrary: and the Council may publish the same
in any way, and at any time, that they may think proper.
But should the Council refuse or neglect, within a reasonable
time, to publish such Paper, the author shall have a
right to copy the same, and publish it under his own
directions. No other person, however, shall publish any
Paper belonging to the Society, without the previous
consent of the Council.</p>

<p>The Council of the Anthropological Society of London have much
pleasure in reporting to the Fellows of the Society that they consider
the state of the Society to be satisfactory and most encouraging. The
past year has been one of great anxiety to the Council, inasmuch as
the scheme proposed by the original circular of the Society was so
vast, that the Council at first nearly despaired of being able to carry
it out in all its particulars. The Council now beg to submit a few
remarks on each of the objects for which the Society was founded,
and also to add some suggestions for the consideration of the Society.</p>

<p><i>Meetings.</i> During the past year, <i>i.e.</i> since February 24, thirteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
ordinary meetings of the Society have been held, at which twenty-four

<p>The Council hope that during the next year some most important
and valuable memoirs will be laid before the Society.</p>

<p>The discussions have been satisfactory, and many Fellows and
visitors had taken part in them.</p>

<p><i>Transactions.</i> The Council, at the early part of the year, made
arrangements with Messrs. Trübner and Co. to publish the Journal
of the Society in connection with the <i>Anthropological Review</i>. This
has hitherto been carried out, and the Council think that the connection
between the <i>Review</i> and <i>Journal</i> will soon be better understood.
At first the <i>Journal</i> was printed as part of the <i>Review</i>, but the Council
have now made arrangements that the <i>Journal</i> shall be paged differently,
and it will then be seen for which part of this publication the
Society is alone responsible. The <i>Journal</i> for the ensuing year will
occupy a far larger space than it has hitherto done. An offer was
made to the Council of the copyright of the <i>Anthropological Review</i>,
which the Council felt it their duty to decline. The <i>Memoirs</i> have
not yet been published, but a volume is now in the press. A general
wish of the Fellows induced the Council to order the separate publication
of the President’s paper “On the Negro’s Place in Nature,” which
will, however, again appear in the forthcoming volume of <i>Memoirs</i>.</p>

<p><i>Museum.</i> Many valuable donations have been made to the Museum,
and many other presents have been offered when a suitable
place has been found for the deposit. The following gentlemen have
made donations to the Museum:&mdash;Dr. James Hunt, Rev. H. F.
Rivers, W. W. Reade, Esq., George Witt, Esq., Erasmus Wilson,
Esq., C. Carter Blake, Esq., Dr. R. Fairbank, Captain R. F. Burton,
R. T. Gore, Esq., T. Bendyshe, Esq., and A. A. Fraser, Esq.</p>

<p><i>Library.</i> The Library now consists of more than two hundred
volumes. The Council have only recently made an effort to establish
a Library; but they trust ere long to have such an Anthropological
Library for the use of the Fellows as has never before existed in this
metropolis. The Council also beg to suggest to the Fellows that they
may all have works which, comparatively valueless in themselves,
would yet be of the highest value in an Anthropological Library.
Donations have already been received from the following gentlemen:&mdash;Dr.
James Hunt, (one hundred and eighteen volumes) T.
Bendyshe, Esq., J. Jones, Esq., Professor Busk, Dr. W. Bell, M.
Boucher de Perthes, the Anthropological Society of Paris, M. Paul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>

of Cornwall, Dr. Beke, Sir W. Jardine, Dr. Cuthbert Collingwood,

Science of Vienna, the Society of Antiquaries, G. McHenry, Esq.,

London, George Witt, Esq., Professor R. Wagner, Professor Tennant,
G. E. Roberts, Esq., A. Higgins, Esq., C. von Martius, Dr.
Beddoe, and G. Pouchet.</p>

<p><i>Translations.</i> The Council are glad to report that they have
printed the first volume of a translation of Waitz’s <i>Anthropologie der
Naturvölker</i>, and they feel that their best thanks are due to Mr. J.
Frederick Collingwood, for the care and attention with which he
edited this work. Mr. Collingwood has fully explained the reasons
which induced the Council to select this work, and they feel it right
to acquaint the Fellows of their determination during the ensuing
year to issue works which shall not advocate the same opinions as those
put forward by Professor Waitz. The Council are fully impressed
with the necessity of their exercising a strict impartiality in selecting
works for translation. The Council have entrusted the chief management
of the publications of the Society to a Publishing Committee, and
they feel the thanks of the Society are due to this Committee for the
efficient manner in which they have discharged their duties.</p>

<p>It is proposed that the following works should be next undertaken
by the Society:&mdash;</p>

<p>Broca. Sur l’Hybridité Animale en général, et sur l’Hybridité

<p><i>Committees.</i> Two Committees have been appointed. The first to
report on the terminology of Anthropological Science; and the
second to report on the present state of the Anthropological Museums
in Great Britain. The result of the reports will be issued to the
Fellows as soon as they are known.</p>

<p><i>Societies.</i> Arrangements have been made to exchange Transactions
with the following Societies in Great Britain:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left padl2">
The Royal Society.<br />
Society of Antiquaries of London.<br />
Royal Society of Literature.<br />

The Glasgow Geological Society.<br />
Cotteswold Naturalists’ Field Club.<br />
Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool.<br />
</p>

<p>Arrangements have been made for an exchange of publications with
the following Academies and Societies, several of which have forwarded
to the Society complete sets of their Proceedings and
Memoirs:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left padl2">
The Anthropological Society of Paris.<br />
The Royal Academy of Sciences at Amsterdam.<br />
The Imperial German Academy at Dresden.<br />
The Royal Society of Victoria, Melbourne.<br />

The Canadian Institute, Toronto.<br />
The Imperial Academy of Sciences, Vienna.<br />
The Royal Bengal Asiatic Society, Calcutta.<br />
The Upper Hesse Society for Natural and Medical Science, Giessen.<br />
The Physio-economical Society of Königsburg.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>In the foreign department, eighteen gentlemen have been elected
Honorary Fellows, thirty-five Corresponding Members, and twenty
Local Secretaries. Communications have been received from nearly
all of these gentlemen, expressing great interest in the work of the
Society and offering to advance its objects in every way in their
power.</p>

<p><i>Honorary Fellows.</i> The Council have felt it their duty to limit
the present number of Honorary Fellows to twenty-five. It is proposed,
however, eventually to increase this number to forty.</p>

<p><i>Corresponding Members.</i> Thirty-five Corresponding Members have
been elected, and the Council recommend that no more than forty
be elected.</p>

<p><i>Local Secretaries.</i> Twenty-two Local Secretaries have been appointed
in Great Britain, of these seven are Fellows of the Society.
The Council are still anxious to increase this number, and to have
their official representative in every county, and also in every large
town throughout the kingdom. They will be glad to hear from gentlemen
who are really anxious to promote the objects of the Society.
Twenty Local Secretaries have been appointed abroad, but the Council
hope during the next year that their number will be largely increased.
The Council invite the assistance of the Fellows in nominating gentlemen
to fill this important office in different parts of the world. The
Council have not yet been able “to indicate the class of facts required,”
but they hope during the ensuing session to be able to do so.</p>

<p><i>Donations.</i> Besides the valuable donations which the Society have
received for the Library and Museum, they have also the pleasure of
announcing the following:&mdash;Henry Christy, Esq., £5.; J. F. Collingwood,
Esq., £10; S. E. Collingwood, Esq., £5.; Henry Hotze, Esq.
£5 (for the library).</p>

<p><i>Special Donations.</i> The following sums have been received as a
special fund for preparing or stuffing a specimen of male Gorilla,
presented to the Society by Mr. Winwood Reade:&mdash;J. Frederick
Collingwood, Esq., £5; S. E. B. Bouverie Pusey, Esq., £5; S. E.
Collingwood, Esq., £5; James Hunt, Esq., £1; Charles Stenning,
Esq., £1; C. R. des Ruffières, £1; W. Chamberlain, Esq., 5s.</p>

<p>The Council having made a few remarks on each of the chief objects
of the Society, would now beg to invite the attention of the
Fellows to the important question of Finance, which will necessarily
regulate its future operations. The experience of the past year has
convinced the Council, after mature and earnest consideration, that
the objects of the Society cannot be fully carried out until there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Five hundred Fellows. The Council would, therefore, suggest the
desirability of not increasing the subscription or of making an entrance
fee, until this number has been obtained. It will be readily seen that
the objects of this Society include something more than those generally
included in a scientific society, and that the expense of printing
is very large. The Council are glad, however, to state that the
present number of Fellows, two hundred and thirty-six, will
enable them to accomplish all they have done during the past year;
but they feel that the ultimate success of a Society of this sort will
require a larger annual expenditure. The Council feel especially
anxious to establish as soon as possible a good reference library. They
also look forward with earnest hope of being able to found a reliable
Anthropological Museum, and thus remove the disgrace under which
this country is now suffering, that with all our colonial possessions no
independent Anthropological Museum has yet been established in this
Metropolis.</p>

<p>The Council are fully sensible of the important services which the
officers of the Society have rendered during the past year, and they
feel that it is their duty to again call on all the officers for renewed
exertion during the ensuing year. The Council trust that the ample
success which their efforts have met during the past year, will be an
encouragement to the official representatives of the Council to again
use their exertions to put the affairs of the Society in a permanently
satisfactory state.</p>

</span>HIS Society is formed with the object of
promoting the study of Anthropology in a strictly
scientific manner. It proposes to study Man in
all his leading aspects, physical, mental, and
historical; to investigate the laws of his origin
and progress; to ascertain his place in nature and
his relations to the inferior forms of life; and to attain these
objects by patient investigation, careful induction, and the encouragement
of all researches tending to establish a <i>de facto</i>
science of man. No Society existing in this country has proposed
to itself these aims, and the establishment of this Society, therefore,
is an effort to meet an obvious want of the times.</p>

<p>This it is proposed to do:</p></div>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>First. By holding Meetings for the reading of papers and
the discussion of various anthropological questions.</p>

<p>Second. By the publication of reports of papers and abstracts
of discussions in the form of a Quarterly Journal; and also
by the publication of the principal memoirs read before
the Society, in the form of Transactions.</p>

<p>Third. By the appointment of Officers, or Local Secretaries,
in different parts of the world, to collect systematic information.
It will be the object of the Society to indicate
the class of facts required, and thus tend to give a systematic
development to Anthropology.</p>

<p>Fourth. By the establishment of a carefully collected and
reliable Museum, and a good reference Library.</p>

<p>Fifth. By the publication of a series of works on Anthropology
which will tend to promote the objects of the Society. These
works will generally be translations; but original works
will also be admissible.</p>

<p>The translation of the following work is now ready.</p>

<p><big><span class="dropcap">W</span>aitz’s Introduction to Anthropology.</big></p>

<p>Edited, from the <span class="smcap">First Volume</span> of <i>Anthropologie der Naturvölker</i>, by
J. FREDERICK COLLINGWOOD, F.R.S.L., F.G.S., F.A.S.L., Foreign Associate
of the Anthropological Society of Paris, Honorary Secretary of the Anthropological
Society of London.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Extract of a Letter from the Author to the Editor.</i></p>

<p>“I have received your translation of the first volume of my ‘<i>Anthropologie der
Naturvölker</i>,’ and hasten to return you my heartfelt thanks for the great care and
assiduity which you have bestowed on the task. I am fully cognisant of the
great difficulties you have to contend with, especially as my style, as alluded to
in your preface, possesses many peculiarities, so that even German men of
science consider the reading of my books rather hard work. All these difficulties
you have surmounted with the greatest skill, so as to render my work, as it
appears to me, into very pleasing, readable English.”</p>

<hr class="small" />
<p class="center">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>“A more felicitous selection could not,
we conceive, by any possibility have been
made than the very one which has resulted
in the publication of the book
lying before us. For within the compass
of the first volume of Dr. Waitz’s
<i>Anthropologie der Naturvölker</i> is compacted
together the most comprehensive
and exhaustive survey of the new
science yet contributed, we believe, in
any tongue to European literature. To
the English public generally, however,
it is a book almost unknown, saving and
excepting alone by reputation. Although
merely a translation from the
German, therefore, the work is virtually,
if not an original work, a perfectly new
work to the mass of readers in this
country. So far as this same rapidly
executed work of translation can be
compared and collated with the original,
it appears to be a version singularly
faithful and accurate.... The book, as it
now appears, is a work of especial value,
and also one of very peculiar interest.
It thoroughly fulfils its design of affording
the reader of it, within a single
volume, the very best epitome anywhere
to be found of what is the actual
‘present state’ of anthropological science
in Christendom. Dr. Waitz takes
a far wider range within his ken than
Prichard and Nott and Gliddon combined.”&mdash;<i>The
Sun</i>, Dec. 14, 1863.</p>

<p>“The volume in every page exhibits
great research; it abounds with interesting
speculation, all tending the right
way, and the information it presents is
happily conveyed in a popular manner.”&mdash;<i>Morning
Advertiser</i>, Nov. 16, 1863.</p>

<p>“So comprehensive is the view taken
by the author of all that pertains to
man, that a mere enumeration even of the
leading topics of the work is beyond
our space, and we must content ourselves
with recommending its perusal to
such of our readers as are interested in
the subject, with the assurance that it
will well repay the trouble.”&mdash;<i>Weekly
Dispatch</i>, Nov. 29, 1863.</p>

<p>“This handsomely printed volume
discusses at great length and with
much ability the question as to the races
of man.... At the hands of Dr. Waitz it
has met with calm consideration, and in
its English dress will prove both interesting
and instructive. It displays
great research, and contains a large extent
of highly interesting matter.”&mdash;<i>Liverpool
Albion</i>, Nov. 9, 1863.</p>

<p>“From such a bill of fare, our readers
will be able to judge that the work is
one of value and interest.... It is of
the nature of a review, arriving at a
comprehensive and proportional estimate,
rather than at minute accuracy
of detail, such as may be sought elsewhere
in each department.”&mdash;<i>Medical
Times</i>, Dec. 26, 1863.</p>

<p>“Crammed as full of hard facts as
wellnigh 400 pages of large 8vo. can
contain: all these facts attested by footnote
authorities marshalled knee-deep
at the bottom of every page; with a list
of contents so copious as to eclipse
everything of the kind in any recent
scientific volume, and yet followed by
an index more minute and ample; this
work is a magazine of the infant science
of Man; a model of German industry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
erudition, and philosophical devotion;
and a credit to the Society which has
sent forth, in a shape so serviceable,
what might otherwise have proved a
tantalising mass of learned collectanea....
We have perused this translated
volume with alternate wonder and
amazement at its strange assemblage
of facts, its curious classifications, its
marvellous revelations of human peculiarities;
and we do not hesitate to say
that more food for speculation, a more
cosmopolitan and comprehensive glance
over all the developments of savage and
civilised man has been collected here,
than could have been dreamed of by those
who may not have given it a perusal.”&mdash;<i>Dorset
County Chronicle</i>, Nov. 18, 1863.</p>

<p>“Dr. Waitz would appear to have
collected together all the authorities
and contradictory statements of former
writers.... The present work will be
hailed with pleasure by all who are interested
in the study of anthropology,
and will, it is hoped, induce a more
universal acquaintance with the science.”&mdash;<i>Observer</i>,
Nov. 8, 1863.</p>

<p>“The Anthropological Society of
London have done well in publishing
a translation of Dr. Waitz’s <i>Anthropologie
der Naturvölker</i>, of which this
volume is the first instalment. Dr.
Waitz’s work is by far the most complete
that exists on the subject of
which it treats. It is the fullest collection
of facts, interwoven with, and
made to bear upon, all the theories
(and their name is legion) which have
been advanced in explanation of the
endless diversities and resemblances
that exist among mankind. Dr. Waitz
himself is wedded to no particular
theory, and in this volume, at least,
advances none, but he points out with
great clearness the effects that may be
fairly attributed to the various influences,
external and internal, physical
and psychical, which affect the human
form and national character.”&mdash;<i>The
Press</i>, Dec. 5, 1863.</p>

<p>“This volume will help to put the
science of anthropology in a proper
light before the scientific men of this
country. Whatever faults we may have
to find with this work, we feel sure that
its publication marks an epoch in the
study of anthropology in this country.
The anthropologist can now say to the
inquirer, Read and study Waitz, and
you will learn all that science has yet to
reveal.”&mdash;<i>Anthropological Review</i>, No. 3.</p>

<p>“The Anthropological Society deserve
great praise for the energy and
activity they display in prosecuting
their object.... We find in this volume
a fair statement and discussion of the
questions bearing on the unity of man
as a species, and his natural condition.
He gives a very clear account of the
different views held on these questions,
and a full collection of the facts, or
supposed facts, by which they are supported.
The chief fault of the book is,
indeed, this very fulness and fairness in
collecting all that can be said on both
sides of a question.... We must regard
the work as a valuable addition to the
books on this subject already in our
language, and as likely, by the thought
and inquiry it must suggest, to promote
the great end of the Society&mdash;a truer and
higher knowledge of man, his origin,
nature, and destiny.”&mdash;<i>The Scotsman</i>,
Dec. 7, 1863.</p>

<p>“We need hardly say, that it is quite
out of our power to give any detailed
account of this volume. It is itself a
volume of details. Its nature, character,
and value, may be gleaned from
the criticism bestowed upon it by the
Anthropological Society, and by the
fact of its being their first offering to
their members. There can be no doubt
that it is the best epitome of matters
anthropological now contained in our
language; and will be of great service
to the student as a book of reference.”&mdash;<i>British
Medical Journal</i>, December
26, 1863.</p>

<p>“The difficulties which a reader
experiences who studies Waitz’s original
German version&mdash;difficulties attendant
on the involution of his style, and the
frequent mistiness of his forms of
expression&mdash;vanish in the English
edition, which also differs from its
German prototype, inasmuch as the
embarrassing references which Waitz
intercalated in his text are prudently
cast down by Mr. Collingwood to the
foot of the page.... The student will
but have to read it through, in order to
feel himself endowed with an enormous
power of acquired facts, which, if he
duly assimilates, will enable him to
wield a tremendous weapon in controversy
against the unskilled anthropologist.”&mdash;<i>Reader</i>,
November 7, 1863.</p>
